 * of three forms it had -- `arrayType()?.stringType()`, then `stringType()`,
 * then whether that carried an `INTEGER_LITERAL` -- and then navigated an
 * `ExpressionContext` for the initializer. Both of those walks belong to the
 * planner now; what reaches the renderer is the answer.
 *
 * A declaration that is not a string at all is `null` at the call site, not a
 * fourth arm here. The old shape returned `{ code: "", handled: false }` and
 * every caller had to remember to check `handled` before reading `code`; with
 * the question answered where the plan is built, "not a string" is a plan that
 * was never made.
