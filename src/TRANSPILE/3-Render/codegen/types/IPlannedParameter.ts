/**
 * A function parameter, reduced to what ADR-006's signature adapter asks of it.
 *
 * #1445: `ParameterInputAdapter.fromAST` took a `ParameterContext` and three
 * callbacks that each took another parse node. Everything it did with them was
 * to turn a node into a string -- a type name, a mapped C type, a dimension --
 * and every decision it makes afterwards is about those strings and
 * `CodeGenState`. So the strings come over instead.
 *
 * The sibling `fromSymbol` already took a record of facts (`IParameterSymbol`).
 * The two now differ in WHICH record rather than in kind, which is the shape
 * the .c/.h divergences this adapter keeps fixing (#914, #1164, #1545) would
 * eventually be closed from.
