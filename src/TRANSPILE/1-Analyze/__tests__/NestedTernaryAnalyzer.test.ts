/**
 * #1322. ADR-022 forbids a ternary inside a ternary's branches; the nesting is
 * where the operator stops being readable and MISRA stops being satisfiable.
 *
 * The check it replaces was a SUBSTRING TEST on the branch's source text:
 *
 *     if (text.includes("?") && text.includes(":"))
 *
 * which rejects `(n = 1) ? "a?b:c" : "plain"` -- a legal ternary whose true
 * branch is a string literal that happens to contain both characters. Verified
 * by probe before this analyzer existed.
 *
 * A rule about SYNTAX asked about characters. The parse tree already has the
 * answer, and asking it is both simpler and correct.
