/**
 * Issue #1322: has this BRANCH lost a diagnostic?
 *
 * `npm run diagnostics:manifest:check` compares the committed manifest against
 * the working tree. That is right per commit and says nothing across a branch:
 * a commit that deletes a row AND its fixture is internally consistent and
 * passes, and so does the next one, and the loss is only visible by comparing
 * the two ends.
 *
 * #1322's definition of done is the across-the-branch claim -- 145 diagnostics
 * relocate, 23 are deleted, and none may vanish unremarked -- so the comparison
 * it needs did not exist. This is it:
 *
 *     npm run diagnostics:manifest:compare -- origin/main
 *
 * It reads the base manifest with `git show <ref>:docs/diagnostic-manifest.md`
 * and compares CODE SETS, not fixture paths, because this card also moves
 * fixtures into `tests/adr-NNN/`. See `DiagnosticManifest.compareToBase`.
 *
 * Not in `gate.sh`: it needs a base ref, and the right one is a property of the
 * branch rather than of the tree.
