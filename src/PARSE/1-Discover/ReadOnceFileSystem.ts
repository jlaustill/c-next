/**
 * One run's read-only view of the host port, in which each file's text is read
 * once (#1444, owner ruling 3).
 *
 * 1.1 Discover reads through it, so every part of discovery that asks for a
 * file sees the same text. `platformio.ini` was read once per directory that
 * resolved includes, for `lib_extra_dirs`, and then again in Stage 3 for
 * ADR-049's target. A save between those reads gave discovery one version of
 * the file and the target another. Discovery now parses the project from
 * this view too, so the target is read from the same text.
 *
 * Read-only, because 1.1 changes nothing on disk: 3.1 Write owns every change
 * (#1653). A view that forwarded the mutating methods would be one more module
 * able to write, so each refuses instead, and so does the preprocessor's
 * scratch file, which 1.1 never needs.
