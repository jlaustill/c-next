# Unified operand typing for #1668: final design (synthesis)

> **A design record, not the current state.** Written at `da2f84918`, before
> implementation. Its `file:line` citations, counts and descriptions of the code
> are that commit's. The addendum's later rulings override it where they differ,
> and the decisions themselves are ADR-024's and ADR-049's.

**Baseline.** Branch `fix/1668-reject-mixed-int-float-arithmetic` at `da2f84918`. Its `src/` is identical to `4b896bb42`. `main` is `f8651d55d`. This design changes no repository file.

**Evidence tags.**

- `file:line` citations were read at `da2f84918`.
- **[ran]** means run on the head2 archive, with the probe directory named.
- Baseline counts were re-measured at `da2f84918` at `2026-09-26T18:13Z`, using the commands in §0.4.

**Spine.** This design takes **"risk-first"** as its spine, because judges 2 and 3 chose it; judge 1 chose "incremental". It fixes every fatal flaw any judge raised against the spine. It adds grafts from "artifact-first" and "incremental", and each graft is marked where it is used.

| G3  | `symbols.structFields` holds what the file and its includes see | This file's own structs only. `mergeExternalSymbols` spreads `...base` and does not merge `structFields`, `structFieldDimensions` or `scopeMembers` (`VisibleSymbols.ts:129-149`).   |
| G4  | `SymbolTable.getStructFieldInfo` holds C header structs only    | `addTSymbol` registers the fields of every C-Next struct for the whole run (`SymbolTable.ts:176-177`, `:191-204`). The comment at `TranspileState.ts:1283` is stale.                 |
| G11 | The type-registry map cites ETR lines                           | The correct ETR lines are: `callReturnType :490`, `getMemberTypeInfo :817`, cast arm `:765`, `resolveIdentifier` call `:732`.                                                        |

### 0.2 Claims that judges accepted or left open, overturned or refined here

1. **`f32 x <- k * w[0, 8]` cannot be the evidence for #1668 box 3.** Artifact-first proposed it, and judges 2 and 3 recorded "M-18 reddens it". **[ran]** in `probes/synth-veto/`:
   - Unmodified head2 emits `float x = k * ((w) & 0xFFU);`.
   - With the veto line `PrimitiveKindUtils.ts:79` deleted in a copy of `src/`, the output is still `float x = k * ((w) & 0xFFU);`.
   - The cause: a bit range has no declared overflow behavior, so `getCompositeOverflowBehavior` (`ETR.ts:192-207`) returns null and no clamp is emitted either way. The unified rule keeps that population (§5), so this fixture can never go red.
2. **The one shape that reaches the veto after unification is a C++ overload set whose return categories disagree.** **[ran]** in `probes/synth-ovl/`:
   - The header declares `uint32_t choose(uint32_t)` first and `float choose(float)` second.
   - `f32 r <- u * choose(y)` emits `float r = cnx_clamp_mul_u32(u, choose(y));`.
   - The g++ run prints `6.000000`; the correct value is 7.5.
   - This is a live miscompile at HEAD. It becomes the #1668 box 3 fixture (§8.1).
3. **Artifact-first said `_inferPointerTypeFromFunctionCall` "always returns null". That is false.** `CodeGenWalker.ts:4491-4526` returns `${declaredType}*` when a C function returns `T*` for a declared `T`. All three arms are kept (§2.4). A fixture is added, because the #958 arm currently shadows this arm in the only fixture that has one.
4. **ADR-024:463-476 ("Two divergences preserved") is stale.** `IntegerConversionAnalyzer.ts:132-142` records that the composite divergence was ruled a bug and closed. Artifact-first's "preserve it" is rejected.
5. **The spine's §10.3 "file G1, G2, the three type-registry probes, C12/C25/C31/C33" is stale.** All of these already exist, as #1698, #1699, #1702, #1700, #1701 and #1690–#1693. They were queried with `gh api repos/jlaustill/c-next/issues/<n>` at `2026-09-26T18:11:04Z`, and all are open.
6. **The spine said `EnumTypeResolver` "keeps only label qualification". That is wrong.** Its one entry, `resolve()` (`:53`), answers "which enum type is this expression", for its one caller at `CodeGenWalker.ts:901`. Qualifying the label is `SwitchGenerator`'s job. The module is deleted (§4.2).
7. **Citation fixes to the spine:**
   - `widestIntegerOf` is at `PrimitiveKindUtils.ts:76`, not `:207`.
   - `Object.freeze` is at `Program.ts:162`.
   - `testAnalysisContext` has **32** users, not 33.

## 1. Result structure and the one typer API

### 1.1 Contracts

Each contract is in its own file under `src/transpiler/types/`, and each is pure data.

**Moved in:**

- `TSubscriptKind`, from `2-Plan`. It is a four-string union.
- `TChainRoot` (`"this" | "global" | null`), from `1-Analyze/types`.

```ts
// TEssentialCategory.ts
type TEssentialCategory =
  | "signed"
  | "unsigned"
  | "floating"
  | "boolean"
  | "enum"
  | "character"
  | "none";

// IOperandType.ts
interface IOperandType {
  readonly type: TType; // settled element type, after every applied subscript
  readonly typeName: string; // TypeResolver.getTypeName(type): the one spelling ('u32','S__Cfg')
  readonly dimensions: ReadonlyArray<number | string>; // dimensions still to subscript, leading first; [] = scalar
  readonly category: TEssentialCategory; // decided once (G8)
  readonly bitWidth: number | null;
  readonly stringCapacity: number | null;
  readonly enumTypeName: string | null; // via DeclaredTypeFacts.of (one derivation)
  readonly bitmapTypeName: string | null;
  readonly overflow: TOverflowBehavior | null; // ONLY for a whole named variable (today's population, ETR:214-279)
  readonly hasSideEffect: boolean; // evaluating it calls a function or reads a volatile/atomic declaration
  readonly form: TOperandForm; // what caller policy reads (§5)
  readonly binding: TValueBinding | null; // for a name-rooted operand; declaration flags live here
}

// TOperandForm.ts
type TOperandForm =
  | { kind: "declared" } // variable, param, for-var, field, element, scope/register member, bitmap field
  | { kind: "call"; calleeCName: string }

      suffixed: boolean;
    }
  | { kind: "cast" }
  | { kind: "bitIndex" }
  | { kind: "bitRange"; width: number | null } // width folded by the one const environment (§2.4)

- **Signature types.** The `unknown` shapes above stand for the existing `SymbolTable` return types. They are copied verbatim when the interface is written, because the `unknown-carriers` gate forbids an `unknown` parameter.
- **Declaration flags.** `isConst`, `isAtomic`, `isVolatile`, pointer and parameter kind are read from `binding`, never copied onto the value. They are facts about the declaration, and §2 is their only source.
- **`TTypeInfo`** (`TTypeInfo.ts`) stays as what render reads. It gets **one** producer, `DeclaredTypeInfo.of(binding, symbols)` in 2-Plan (§4.3). That producer replaces all of these:
  - `TypeRegistrationEngine`
  - `FunctionContextManager.registerParameterType :247-287`
  - `DeclaredVariableFacts.fromSymbol :80-137`
  - `TranspileState.getMemberTypeInfo`

### 1.2 The API

The typer lives in `src/utils/OperandTyper.ts`. It is a static class with no fields and no module state (from the spine).

```ts
class OperandTyper {
  /** Value type of any expression-level node: descends single-child levels, parens, unary, ternary, composites. */
  static typeOf(
    node: ParserRuleContext,
    ctx: ITypingContext,
  ): IOperandType | null;
  /** Per-op typing of a postfix chain or assignment target. */
  static chainOf(
    node: Parser.PostfixExpressionContext | Parser.AssignmentTargetContext,
    ctx: ITypingContext,
  ): IChainTyping;
  /** VALUE leaves of one arithmetic/relational level, by the ONE collection rule (§3.6). */
  static valueLeaves(
    node: ParserRuleContext,
    ctx: ITypingContext,
  ): ReadonlyArray<IOperandType | null>;
  /** Form boolean, or type bool. A bitIndex is NOT boolean (OperandTypeResolver.ts:126-129, preserved). */
  static isBoolean(t: IOperandType | null): boolean;
}
```

**Companion utils modules.** Each exists because two or more passes call it.

| Module                             | What it holds                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/utils/CompositeType.ts`       | `integerOf(leaves)` and `anyFloating(leaves)`. It replaces `PrimitiveKindUtils.widestIntegerOf :76` and `anyFloating :98`. |
| `src/utils/SubscriptClassifier.ts` | Moved. `isArrayAccess` takes `Pick<TTypeInfo, "isArray" \| "isString"> \| null`.                                           |
| `src/utils/ChainRoot.ts`           | Moved from `1-Analyze/helpers`.                                                                                            |
| `src/utils/DeclaredPointer.ts`     | `of(decl, foreign)` and `calleeOf(expr)` (§2.4).                                                                           |
| `src/utils/ForeignTypeFacts.ts`    | Rewritten to `operandType(...)` (§3.5).                                                                                    |

**Placement.**

- It cannot go in `1-Analyze`: `render-cannot-import-analyzers` forbids that.
- It cannot go in `2-Plan`: `analyze-cannot-import-plan` forbids that.
- The typer imports none of `TranspileState`, `IAnalysisContext`, `1-Analyze`, `2-Plan`, `3-Render`, `4-Resolve`, `BitUtils` or the `Program` class. The existing rules enforce this through reachability (§8.5).

**What each caller passes.**

- **2.1:** `this.context`. `IAnalysisContext` (`1-Analyze/types/IAnalysisContext.ts:44-64`) gains `readonly sourceFile: string`. It then satisfies `ITypingContext` structurally, because `SymbolTable` satisfies `IForeignSymbolLookup`. `Transpiler._analyzeFile` adds `sourceFile: sourcePath` to the literal at `Transpiler.ts:1017-1023`.
- **2.2 and 2.3:** `state.typingContext()`, a new method on `TranspileState`. It is modelled on `typeBindingDeps()` (`:945`). It builds a fresh object each call and stores nothing. It uses `invariant()` to assert `symbols` (`:510`), `program` (`:525`) and `sourcePath` (`:741`), the same way `Transpiler.ts:1004-1008` does.
- **Positions** always come from the node (`ParserUtils.getPosition`, `:28-35`). The typer never reads `currentScopePath`, `resolveIdentifier`, `localVariables` or a registry.

**Statelessness.** The answer is a pure function of `(node, ctx)`. `ctx.program` is frozen (`Program.ts:162`). A unit test asserts that the class declares no field. `passes-hold-no-mutable-state` does not scan `utils`: its `PASS_ROOTS` are `src/PARSE` and `src/TRANSPILE` (`:70`).

## 2. The declaration artifact

### 2.1 What it holds

```ts
// src/transpiler/types/ILexicalFrame.ts
interface ILexicalFrame {
  readonly kind: "file" | "scope" | "function" | "block" | "for";
  readonly span: ISourceSpan; // the construct that opened it (ParserUtils.getSpan)
  readonly scopePath: string; // "" outside a scope
  readonly functionCName: string | null; // "function" frames: IFunctionSymbol identity
  readonly declarations: ReadonlyArray<ILocalDeclaration>; // source order
  readonly children: ReadonlyArray<ILexicalFrame>; // source order, non-overlapping
}
// src/transpiler/types/ILocalDeclaration.ts
interface ILocalDeclaration {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly kind: "local" | "parameter" | "for" | "constructor";
  readonly span: ISourceSpan; // span of the declarator IDENTIFIER
  readonly type: TType; // 1.3 may leave TDeferredType; 1.4 settles it
  readonly arrayDimensions: ReadonlyArray<number | string>; // ADR-035 inferred; folded by 1.4 in the lexical const env
  readonly isConst: boolean;
  readonly isAtomic: boolean;
  readonly isVolatile: boolean;
  readonly overflowBehavior: TOverflowBehavior; // fromModifier; never absent; parameter => "clamp"
  readonly initialValue: string | null; // ADR-045 capacity, const folding, ADR-046 text test
  readonly initializerCallee: string | null; // #895: DeclaredPointer.calleeOf(initializer) (Tier-1 text)
  readonly constValue: number | null; // 1.4: a const local folded in the lexical environment
}
```

**Coverage.** The artifact covers every function body, braced block, `for` header (`forVarDecl`, `CNext.g4:300-302`: atomic, volatile and overflow, but no const), constructor declaration (`CNext.g4:197`) and scope body, together with how they nest.

**Kept out on purpose.**

- File-scope globals and scope members stay as the `IVariableSymbol`s they already are, in `IFileSymbols.symbols`, and are reached by C-name identity. They are visible regardless of position, matching `registerAllVariableTypes` (`CodeGenWalker.ts:2338-2342`).
- Locals are never added to `SymbolTable`, whose bare-name index is G12's hazard (`SymbolTable.ts:219-222`).

**Facts the frames lack today.** These are overflow, atomic, parameter, pointer, size, capacity and const values (`IDeclaredVar.ts:31-48`). All of them come from decoders that already exist:

| Fact                                                     | Source                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type, modifiers, ADR-045 capacity, ADR-035 inferred size | `VariableCollector.collect` (`:158`) is split into `declaredFacts(ctx, scopePath, constValues, isScopeType)` plus identity. Globals and locals then share one derivation.       |
| Overflow                                                 | `OverflowBehaviorUtils.fromModifier` (`:26-33`) returns `"clamp"` for null. Parameters have no modifier in the grammar (`CNext.g4:165-167`), so #1681 is fixed by construction. |
| Parameter type, const and dimensions                     | Filled by 1.4 from `IFunctionSymbol.parameters` (the one source, settled by `DeferredTypes`). 1.3 records only the frame and the span.                                          |

### 2.2 Who builds it, and when

| Stage                                                                | Pass        | Work                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stage 3: `_declareFile` → `CNextResolver.resolve` (`cnext/index.ts`) | **1.3**     | `src/PARSE/3-Declare/cnext/collectors/LexicalScopeCollector.ts` walks the file once with a listener. Its shape is today's `DeclarationScopeCollector` (`:139-200`), moved and re-keyed. The listener holds only numbers and records. The result goes on a new field, `IFileSymbols.lexicalScopes: ILexicalFrame`. It builds no names (`collectors-build-names-from-scopes`, `.dependency-cruiser.cjs:62-90`). |
| Stage 3: `Program.build` (`Transpiler.ts:772`, `Program.ts:103`)     | **1.4**     | `src/PARSE/4-Resolve/LexicalFrames.ts` runs `settle(files, isScopeType, consts, functionsByCName)`. Step (a) settles deferred types: `DeferredTypes.settleType` (`:173`) becomes public. Step (b) fills parameter declarations. Step (c) folds const locals in source order. Step (d) folds dimensions in the same environment. Step (e) freezes the result.                                                  |
| Stage 4d (`Transpiler.ts:539-548`)                                   | **2.1**     | Reads the artifact through `context.program`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Stage 5 (`:556-570`)                                                 | **2.2/2.3** | Reads the same object through `state.program`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

**Why this ordering works.**

- 2.1 runs on every file before any file is planned. Program is complete before 2.1 and lives for the whole run.
- So G5's choice disappears: there is no node-keyed holder that crosses stages, no roster row, and no rebuild in Stage 5.
- No orchestrator field is added. That is #1671's concern, and it stays untouched.

### 2.3 Query surface, key and lifetime gates

`IProgram` (`src/transpiler/types/IProgram.ts`) gains four methods. `P` is `Pick<ISourceSpan, "line" | "column">`, which `ParserUtils.getPosition` satisfies structurally. It is used so that no shared contract imports `utils/types`.

```ts
lexicalFrameAt(sourceFile: string, at: P): ILexicalFrame;                        // innermost; file frame if none
lexicalDeclarationAt(sourceFile: string, name: string, at: P): ILocalDeclaration | null; // lexical half only (#1398 visibility)
bindValue(sourceFile: string, root: TChainRoot, name: string, at: P): TValueBinding | null;
constValuesAt(sourceFile: string, at: P): ReadonlyMap<string, number>;          // visible local consts over constValuesIn(scopePath)

type TValueBinding =
  | { kind: "local"; declaration: ILocalDeclaration; scopePath: string }
  | { kind: "variable"; symbol: IVariableSymbol }     // global or scope member, by C-name identity
  | { kind: "scope"; scopePath: string }
  | { kind: "foreign"; name: string };
```

- **Stable positions.** Stage 4d and Stage 5 reuse Stage 3's parse (`retainedParses`), so a node's position is the same in every pass.
- **Comparison.** Positions compare lexicographically on `(line, column)`.
- **artifact-lifetime.**
  - `IFileSymbols` and `Program` are already in `ARTIFACTS` (`artifact-lifetime.test.ts:146-160`).
  - `ILexicalFrame` is added by name, so a later field of node type fails on the frame itself.
  - The cases at `:252` (no artifact reaches a parse node), `:294` (pins every field) and `:342` (no pass after 1.3) are unaffected, because nothing new holds a node.
  - The 24 per-analyzer `Map<ParserRuleContext, IScopeFrame>` (`ScopeFrameResolver.ts:29`, `DeclarationScopeCollector.ts:33`) are deleted, not moved.

### 2.4 Const values, dimensions and pointers

**One evaluator.** `ArrayDimensionParser.parseText(text, options)` exposes the text path that `parseSingleDimension` already reduces to (`ArrayDimensionParser.ts:87-111`). Three callers use it:

- 1.4, for const locals.
- 1.4's global consts. This replaces the literal-only `Program.constValueOf` (`Program.ts:631-635`), so 2.2 stops being the only folder of `const u32 B <- A + 1` (`TypeRegistrationEngine.ts:99-105`).
- 2.2's `tryEvaluateConstant` (`CodeGenWalker.ts:1341`), over `constValuesAt`.

**Array dimensions** are read off the settled declaration by both `.c` and `.h`, and are **never re-folded in 2.2**. Otherwise #1538's `.c` and `.h` could split (risk R5).

**`#895`, `#958` and ADR-046.** `DeclaredPointer.of(decl, foreign)` holds the three arms of `CodeGenWalker._inferVariableType :4448-4486`, in order:

1. A typedef-struct type gives `T*` (#958).
2. A C function returning `T*` for a declared `T` gives `T*` (#895 Bug B; `_inferPointerTypeFromFunctionCall :4491-4526`).
3. A `c_` prefix with a `STRUCT_POINTER_C_FUNCTIONS` substring in `initialValue` gives `T*` (ADR-046).

`DeclaredPointer.calleeOf(expr)` is `_extractCFunctionName`, moved. 1.3 calls it to record `initializerCallee`. `_inferVariableType` (the emitted text) and `DeclaredTypeInfo.of` (the flag) both call `DeclaredPointer.of`, so the declaration and its type info cannot disagree.

---

## 3. Name resolution

`at` is the use node's position. The binding decision is `program.bindValue`, the only place a spelling becomes a declaration.

### 3.1 Value names

**A bare name (`root === null`)** resolves in this order:

1. **Lexical frames**, innermost to outermost within the function. In each frame, take the last declaration of `name` whose `span` starts strictly before `at`.
   - This fixes #1702: a later same-block declaration does not bind.
   - It fixes #1666: sibling blocks are disjoint and there is no flat key.
   - It covers locals, parameters and `for` variables.
   - `u8 x <- x` binds the inner `x`, which is today's behavior. That case is still #1643.
2. **The enclosing scope member:** `symbolByCName(ScopeUtils.qualifyInScope(name, frame.scopePath))`. Scopes cannot nest (`CNext.g4:77-88`). A local shadowing a member binds the local, because step 1 runs first. That fixes #1700: today `TranspileState.resolveIdentifier :1223-1236` checks members only.
3. **A file-scope global:** `symbolByCName(name)`. This is exact identity, not `getTSymbol`'s first bare-name match (fixes G12). ADR-063 forbids `__`, so a global cannot collide with a member's C name.
4. **A C-Next scope name** gives `{kind: "scope"}`.
5. **A C or C++ header name** gives `{kind: "foreign"}`.

**`this.x`** looks up `symbolByCName(qualifyInScope(x, frame.scopePath))` across the whole run. A scope reopened in another file (#1333) therefore binds (fixes #1699 and G2). Outside a scope the result is null, which is E0431's case. The false premise at `ScopeFrameResolver.ts:153-156` is deleted along with the file.

**`global.x`** is `symbolByCName(x)` only, never lexical, so a local cannot capture it (fixes #1701; `AssignmentClassifier.ts:100-102`). `global.Scope.x` binds the scope, then the member.

**`Scope.x`** binds the root as `{kind: "scope"}`, then takes the member step `symbolByCName(getTranspiledCName({scopePath, name}))` (fixes C07 and C13). Every spelling goes through the `ScopeUtils` encoders, so `scope-joins:check` gains no `fromParts` site. `OperandTypeResolver.ts:232` goes away.

**Emission shares the decision** (graft from incremental; needed for #1700 box 3). `TypeValidator.resolveBareIdentifier` (`3-Render/codegen/TypeValidator.ts:77-127`) takes the `TValueBinding` instead of `isLocalVariable` plus `_resolveScopeMember`:

- `local` gives `state.emittedLocalName(name)`, which keeps the ADR-057 rename.
- `variable` gives `symbol.fullyQualifiedCName`.
- `foreign` gives null.

The walker's three call sites pass the node's position. The emitted names are expected to be byte-identical, because both orders are already local-first in emission. P3 checks that.

### 3.3 Casts, literals, ternaries, unary operators, shifts, Boolean-valued sub-expressions

| Shape                            | `IOperandType`                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cast `(T)x`                      | `T` resolved through `TypeBinding` (not raw text as at `ETR.ts:765-768`), form `cast`, `hasSideEffect` from the operand. A cast to a header float typedef is floating (C04, C23).       |
| Literal                          | `LiteralUtils.typeOf` (`:137-160`). Integer is `int`, or `uN`/`iN` when suffixed. Float is `f32`/`f64`. `true`/`false` is `bool`. Policy decides what each consumer reads (§5).         |
| Ternary                          | Form `ternary` with both arm types. `type` is the arms' common type, or category `none` when they disagree. The condition is never a leaf (`ParserUtils.ternaryValueArms`, `:252-258`). |
| `(e)`                            | Recurses into `e`. A parenthesized composite or ternary is typed, which fixes `ETR.ts:759-763` and the `(g+1)+1` clamp loss.                                                            |
| `-x`, `~x`                       | The operand's type (2.2's answer, `ETR.ts:790-805`)                                                                                                                                     |
| `!x`                             | Form `boolean`. This is 2.1's answer (`OperandTypeResolver.ts:439-442`) and fixes G10 in 2.2.                                                                                           |
| `&x`                             | null, and never a leaf (#1152)                                                                                                                                                          |
| `a << n`                         | `a`'s type. `n` is never a value leaf (C01).                                                                                                                                            |
| Applied `\|\| && = != < > <= >=` | Form `boolean`. It is one leaf and is not descended (C00).                                                                                                                              |
| `sizeof`, ADR-058 properties     | null. Unchanged in both passes.                                                                                                                                                         |

### 3.4 Fields, elements, bits, enums, bitmaps, registers, strings

| Shape                    | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Field of a C-Next struct | `program.symbolByCName(structCName).fields`. This covers the same file and imports alike. Per G3 and G4, this replaces `StructFieldFacts`' per-file view and `importedFieldType` (`OperandTypeResolver.ts:185-194`). It keeps the three states: `[…]`, `[]` (a scalar that exists) and `null` (unknown). A local typed `this.Cfg` or bare `Cfg` resolves because its `TType` is already `S__Cfg`. So `BareEnumMemberAnalyzer.structSpellings :277-286` is deleted. |
| Field of a C struct      | Only `ForeignTypeFacts`, followed through typedefs. The raw C string (`TranspileState.ts:1284-1292`) is never returned (fixes C15).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Element                  | Removes the **leading** dimension per subscript: 2.1's rule, `OperandTypeResolver.ts:126-134`. Fixes the `grid[1][0]` → `bool` case at `ETR.ts:706-716`. A string element is `char`, category `character`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Subscript kind           | `SubscriptClassifier.classify` (moved, unchanged rule) on `before`. An unknown type still defaults to array access (`SubscriptClassifier.ts` `isArrayAccess(null)`). A bit-range width comes from `constValuesAt` (fixes C18b; `IntegerConversionAnalyzer.ts:302-305` accepted digits only).                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Enum                     | A variable gets `enumTypeName`. `E.A`, `S.E.A` and `this.E.A` get form `enumMember`. This covers every pattern `EnumTypeResolver` handled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Bitmap field `fg.Mode`   | Width from `symbols.bitmapFields`. 1 bit is boolean; a wider field is unsigned of that width (ruling: "however reached").                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Register member `R.M`    | `symbols.registerMemberTypes`, with `overflow: null` (fixes C11). The inverse C-name map goes in `utils/constants`, not `BitUtils`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

### 3.5 Foreign (C/C++) facts, in one place

`ForeignTypeFacts.operandType(nameOrPath, lookup)` replaces both `typeNameOf` (C then C++, `DeclaredVariableFacts.ts:154`) and `typeInfoOf` (C only, `:207-208`). One lookup fixes C16 and C22.

| Shape                                                                             | Answer                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| float, double or long double, directly or through typedefs (`:124-138` loop kept) | Category floating. `long double` fixes C24a.                                                                                                                                          |
| Array variable, or an array of structs                                            | Keeps `arrayDimensions`, which fixes the early struct return at `:36` before the array check at `:37`. `cArr[1]` is a floating element; `cAnons[1].x` resolves (C06, C08, C14, C21).  |
| Array typedef `typedef float vec3[3]`                                             | `CResolver.buildTypedefType` (`c/index.ts:423-440`) records the declarator's dimensions, and a variable inherits them (C20; restores `gv[0U]`).                                       |
| C++ `Ns.f()`, `Ns.v`, `Class.f()`, `obj.m()`                                      | Key `Ns::f` / `Class::m`, the key `cpp/collectors/FunctionCollector.ts:58`, `:143` uses (C05). An instance method is reached through its class type.                                  |
| C++ overloads (`getCppOverloads`, `SymbolTable.ts:415-417`)                       | One category when every overload agrees. Otherwise form `foreign`, `indeterminate: true` (C03).                                                                                       |
| C++ `using` and typedef aliases; a C function-pointer field                       | The alias is followed. A function-pointer call result is the return part of its typedef (C24b, C24c). P1 confirms the collectors record these; any shape they do not record is filed. |
| C and C++ integers                                                                | Stay untyped, per #978 (`ForeignTypeFacts.ts:5-21`). C09 is open question Q4.                                                                                                         |

A C-Next declaration whose `TType` is `external` (`real_t k`) is typed through the same typedef walk.

### 3.6 The one composite-collection rule

`valueLeaves(node)`:

- **Descends** through arithmetic and bitwise levels, parentheses, ternary **value arms**, and unary `-` and `~`.
- **Stops** at a postfix chain, a cast, a Boolean-valued level or `!` (one `boolean` leaf), and `sizeof` (one untyped leaf).
- **Excludes** `&x` and a shift count.

It replaces four collectors:

- `ETR.collectOperandPostfixes :382-412`
- `IntegerConversionAnalyzer.postfixLeaves :307-319`, which lacked the #1152 exclusions (G8)
- `MixedTypeCategoryAnalyzer.collectOperandCategories`/`postfixCategories :128-191`
- The hand copy at `ArrayIndexTypeAnalyzer.ts:186` (C34)

### 4.3 The 59 `getVariableTypeInfo` reads

The accessor becomes `declarationTypeInfo(name, at: ParserRuleContext)` in C7, so the compiler checks that every read carries a position. It is **one** projection in 2-Plan: `bindValue` followed by `DeclaredTypeInfo.of(binding, symbols)`.

`DeclaredTypeInfo.of` reproduces each registry convention exactly, and P2 checks each one:

- A local string is `char`, `isArray`, `[…, N+1]`.
- A scalar string parameter is `"string"` (`FunctionContextManager.ts:199-206`).
- A typedef-struct parameter has `isPointer`.

**Migration rule.** A site changes where its answer comes from, never which expressions it asks about.

**`localArrays`** duplicates the dimensions fact. Its writers are deleted in C7 once its two readers read the typer: `StringDeclHelper.ts:116`, `VariableDeclHelper.ts:147`, `:165`, `ArrayInitHelper.ts:85`, and `TranspileState.ts:624`, `:1513`.

### 4.4 Registry and `constValues` writers deleted

**Registry writers (C8):**

- `TypeRegistrationEngine`, the whole module: `register`, `trackVariable`, every `setVariableTypeInfo`. Its callers at `CodeGenWalker.ts:1676`→`:2345` and `:4623` go too.
- `TypeRegistrationUtils`, the whole module.
- `FunctionContextManager.registerParameterType`'s registry part (`:286`) and the ADR-025 delete (`:350`).
- `CodeGenWalker.planConstructorDecl` set (`:4138`).
- `_markVariableAsPointer` (`:4644-4656`, called at `:4066`).
- `StringDeclHelper.ts:448`.
- `ArrayInitHelper.ts:129-132`, including the in-place mutation.
- `TranspileState`: `typeRegistry :538`, `getVariableTypeInfo :991`, `declaredVariableType :1024`, `getTypeInfo :1036`, `hasVariableTypeInfo :1054`, `setVariableTypeInfo :1061`, `deleteVariableTypeInfo :1068`, `getTypeRegistryView :1077`, `registerType :1379`, and its reset at `:1624`.
- `IGeneratorInput.typeRegistry` (`CodeGenerator.ts:103`).

**`#include <string.h>` (R4, from artifact-first).** The only production `requireInclude("string")` calls for declarations are `TypeRegistrationEngine.ts:346` and `:393`. They move onto the `string<N>` declaration's emission path in the same commit. The check is that the count of `#include <string.h>` across `.expected.*` is equal before and after C8.

**`constValues` (C11):**

- `TranspileState.constValues :541`, `registerConstValue :1386`, and the reset at `:1625`.
- Writers `CodeGenWalker.ts:1746-1748` (seed), `:4638`, `TypeRegistrationEngine.ts:103`.
- `IGeneratorInput.constValues` (`CodeGenerator.ts:107`).

## 5. Policy: explicit caller modes

The typer reports facts. Each deliberate null becomes a named rule on the **one** module that owns the decision, with a unit test per row.

- 2.1 rules are private statics on their analyzer, because each has one owner.
- 2.2 rules share one 2-Plan module, `PlanTyping`, because five 2.2 sites use them.

Wrap if at least one integer leaf is counted and none is clamp. Otherwise null (p, `ETR.ts:192-207`). A leaf counts only when it is a whole named variable (p; #1411 and #1703 stay out). No transitional arm remains. A `for`-variable leaf was skipped ("never registered") until C9 deleted it for #1667, together with its twin in `DeclaredTypeInfo.of`. A parameter leaf counted with no behavior (today's wrap) until C10 deleted it for #1681, and gave the parameter's `DeclaredTypeInfo` its declared behavior, so a compound assignment to a parameter clamps too.                                                |

**Measurement P4** (spine, plus a graft from incremental):

- For each 2.1 commit, run every fixture and example at the parent and the child. Diff the diagnostic sets `(code, file, line)`.
- Also run **each analyzer alone** over every fixture (a throwaway script, not committed). `runAnalyzers.ts:450-463` stops at the first failing analyzer, so a new error can mask a later one.
- Every delta maps to a B id, or it blocks the commit.
- A fixture whose source is now rejected is changed and listed, as the branch already did for `floats/float-arrays` and `multi-dim-arrays/f{32,64}-multi-dim`.

**Measurements:**

- **P1, typing differential.** An instrumented copy of head2 runs the old 2.1 typer, the old 2.2 paths and the overflow lookup beside `OperandTyper`. It covers every operand of every `tests/**/*.cnx` and `examples/**/*.cnx`, in C and in `--cpp`. The output is a TSV `(file, line, text, shape, old21, old22, old22ovf, new)`. An unclassified disagreement blocks C4.
- **P2, registry parity.** An instrumented `getVariableTypeInfo` logs `(site, name, field, old, new)` against `declarationTypeInfo` at all 59 sites during a full run. The convention classes must be 0 before C8. P2 also compares ADR-035 counts: `state.lastArrayInitCount` against `ArrayInitializerUtils.getInferredSize` (R6).
- **P3, commit rehearsal.** For each commit:
  - Run `npm run test:update` in C and C++.
  - Count changed files with `git diff --name-only -- tests | wc -l`.
  - Count changed fixtures with the same list, stems deduplicated.
  - Run a hunk classifier over `git diff -U0 -- 'tests/**/*.expected.*'`. It must report **0 unclassified hunks**.
  - Re-run `npm run test:q`, because a mismatch masks execution.
- **Recording.** Each count is posted on #1668, and also on #1667, #1681 or #1664 for their commits, with the SHA and the command.

## 7. Commit sequence

"Byte-identical" means `npm test` leaves `git status tests/` empty. Every commit builds and passes `npm run build && npm run unit && npm run test:q`.

Generated documents are regenerated **in the commit that changes their input**: `parse-tree`, `scope-joins`, `diagnostics:manifest`, `coverage:matrix`, and `docs:throw-citations` after any `3-Render` edit (#1399).

`npm run test:gate` runs alone, from a committed tree, before the push.

Also: one `test-error` fixture per B2–B17 shape, with C and `--cpp` variants where the shape is C++. C00 and C01 compile. The C20 `vec3 gv` fixture is `// test-no-warnings`, so gcc compiles every unit. C26: an execution fixture counts callback calls and requires 1. C29: E0869 on a callback result and on `get().v`.

**Scope-context matrix for ADR-024** (`adr-024-type-casting.md:441-458`). The rows `scope member` and `scope method` × `imported direct` and `imported transitive` are `off` "as a stated obligation". Per CLAUDE.md's _New PRs use the matrix_, C13 declares them `error` once P4 shows them occupied. The occupying fixtures are:

- `Other.x` from an included file.
- The split-scope `this.x` across an include (#1699).

`npm run coverage:matrix` and `coverage:matrix:check` must then pass. M7 names the transitive cell it reddens.

### 8.2 Unit tests

None exist today for `OperandTypeResolver` or `ScopeFrameResolver` (G13).

The two `AtomicGenerator` tests that pass a null `clampOp` (C30) are retitled to what they assert. The float decision stays pinned by the case above.

### 8.3 Mutation table

**Protocol for every row:**

1. Commit first.
2. Assert the edit applied, by grepping for the marker.
3. Delete stale `.test.c/.h/.cpp/.hpp` between runs.
4. Assert the restore.

A correct row reddens exactly the fixtures it names.

### 8.4 Mocks (G13)

`ExpressionTypeResolver.ts` is deleted, not hollowed, so `mock-paths.test.ts` goes red on both specifiers until they are handled:

- `ArrayHandlers.test.ts:28` is already inert, and its block is removed.
- `UnaryExprGenerator.test.ts:23`: the test is rewritten against the real `TypeCheckUtils.isUnsigned`.

`EnumTypeResolver.test.ts` is deleted with its module.

### 8.5 Gates

**depcruise.** No new rule is added, and the `layer-rules.test.ts` roster is unchanged.

- The typer is covered through reachability by `analyzers-cannot-reach-codegen-state`, `analyze-cannot-import-plan`, `analyze-cannot-import-render`, `nothing-after-resolve-derives-cross-file-facts` and `plan-cannot-import-render`.
- `shared-contracts-cannot-import-a-pass` must pass on the new contracts. It holds because `TSubscriptKind` and `TChainRoot` move and `IForeignSymbolLookup` is structural.
- Mutation checks: `import type TranspileState` in `OperandTyper.ts` turns it red, and so does `import BitUtils`.

**artifact-lifetime.** `ILexicalFrame` is added to `ARTIFACTS`. No roster row changes.

**render-decides-nothing.** The `SubscriptClassifier` row is removed in C12, a visible roster change. `CastRequirement`'s pinned consumer is `NarrowingCastHelper.ts` alone: C5 moved the cast's saturation decision into the plan (`IPlannedCast.clampForm`), so `CastExprGenerator.ts` reads the plan and consults nothing, and its pin was removed. After the review follow-ups the typer is `SubscriptClassifier`'s only caller.

**#1664 box 3 guard.** It is new, beside `render-decides-nothing.test.ts`, and its population controls are listed in M29.

- Arm A, a ts-morph field-type walk: no `Map<string, TTypeInfo>` or `Map<string, number>` field on `TranspileState`, `CodeGenWalker` or anything under `3-Render`. Its population control is that the walk finds the `LexicalFrames`/`Program` maps when pointed at `4-Resolve`.
- Arm B: no import of a declaration-authoring module (`LexicalScopeCollector`, `LexicalFrames`, `VariableCollector`) from those roots. Its population control is a planted specifier string.
- Arm C: `setVariableTypeInfo|deleteVariableTypeInfo|getTypeRegistryView|constValues\.set|TypeRegistration(Engine|Utils)` occurs nowhere in `src/`. Its population control is the regex matched against planted text.

**parse-tree:check.** Regenerated in C2, C3, C4a, C4b, C6 and C8.

- Removed rows: `DeclarationScopeCollector`, `ScopeFrameResolver`, `OperandTypeResolver`, `ExpressionTypeResolver`, `TypeRegistrationEngine`.
- Added rows: `LexicalScopeCollector`, `OperandTyper`. `ChainRoot` moves, which is count-neutral.
- Expected total 102 → 99. The measured figure is recorded. The PR states that typing an expression is tree-shaped, which is why the typer takes nodes.

**Other gates.**

- knip `classMembers`: dead ETR and `TranspileState` members are deleted, not kept.
- `one-struct-decision`: the typer calls `DeclaredTypeFacts.isStruct`.
- `scope-joins`: the list shrinks.
- `unknown-carriers`: no `unknown` parameter, including `IForeignSymbolLookup`.
- Also run `diagnostics:manifest:check`, `error-codes:check`, `docs:throw-citations:check`, `adr:independence:check`, `gate:roster:check`, `typecheck:scripts`, cspell, prettier and oxlint.
- SonarCloud: 0 new issues (`statuses=OPEN,CONFIRMED,REOPENED`, on the head SHA's analysis), coverage of at least 80% on new code, cognitive complexity of at most 15 per method. Moved files re-attribute their issues to this PR.

### 8.6 Documents

**ADR-024** (under Q6; rewrite-test clean, no module names):

- A comparison's result is a Boolean operand, not a category (C00).
- A shift count is never an operand of the enclosing operator (C01).
- E0869 reads call results, callback results and `-x`/`~x` (C29).
- Register members and multi-bit bitmap fields are classified.
- A C++ overload set whose results disagree is not classified.
- The Q3 ruling.
- The matrix cells.
- A refresh of the stale `:463-476` paragraph.

**Supersessions, stated explicitly:**

- `EnumTypeResolver.ts:14-27`. Its premise, that the passes "ask from different symbol views", is false. Both read `program.codeGenSymbolsFor(file)` (`Transpiler.ts:998`, `:1191`) and one lexical artifact through one typer, so "nothing detects that" no longer applies. This is recorded in `docs/architecture/symbol-resolution.md` under a new "Operand typing" section, because the module is deleted.
- `ScopeFrameResolver.ts:153-156` (deleted with the file; this is #1699 box 4).
- `TranspileState.ts:1283` (deleted with the method).
- `PrimitiveKindUtils.ts:54` (C32): the text moves to `CompositeType`, and says the veto covers indeterminate C++ overloads and not float macros (#1688).

**Architecture documents:**

- `docs/architecture/README.md` §2: the Tier 1 table gains lexical declarations.
- `module-destinations.md`:
  - Add utils rows for `OperandTyper`, `CompositeType`, `DeclaredPointer`, `SubscriptClassifier` and `ChainRoot`.
  - Add the 1.3 `LexicalScopeCollector` row and the 1.4 `LexicalFrames` row.
  - Add a "deleted rather than re-homed" entry covering: ETR, `EnumTypeResolver`, `TypeRegistrationEngine`, `TypeRegistrationUtils`, `OperandTypeResolver`, `ScopeFrameResolver`, `DeclarationScopeCollector`, `DeclaredVariableFacts` and `StructFieldFacts`.

**CLAUDE.md.** These entries name deleted modules and are listed for the owner to approve: "Analyzer type tracking", "Adding Generator Effects" (whose examples name `TypeRegistrationEngine`), the registry notes, and "Per-file vs run-wide symbol views".

### 10.2 Unknowns, each settled by a named prototype

- S12, S13 and the B-counts: P1–P4.
- Whether any corpus program relies on G12's first-match fallback: P1.
- Whether `LexicalScopeCollector` meets a tree shape it cannot record: C2's all-fixtures test.

### Open questions for the owner

1. **DoD wording that names what this design replaces.** 2.1 runs before 2.2 and cannot import `2-Plan`, so declaration facts are authored in 1.3/1.4 and no registry remains. How should each of these boxes be recorded: annotated as met by the 1.3/1.4 artifact, or reworded by you?
   - #1664 box 2 ("2.2 registration pass").
   - #1664 box 3 ("decided in 2.2", and guard arms that target the deleted registry).
   - #1664 box 4 ("fields of 2.2's artifact").
   - #1667 box 1 ("registered").
   - #1667 box 4 ("#1668 has landed").
   - #1694 box 3 (names `DeclarationScopeCollector`/`ScopeFrameResolver`).
   - Separately, #1664 box 5 was released on 2026-09-26, but the card body still says it "stays as written".
2. **Placement.** `module-destinations.md:169-171` admits a utils module only if it "decides nothing". Do you accept a whole operand typer, `SubscriptClassifier` and `CompositeType` in `src/utils/`? `1-Analyze` and `2-Plan` are each ruled out by a depcruise rule.
3. **Suffixed integer literals.** Is `5i32` or `300u16` a "bare integer literal" under ADR-052 and ADR-024, so that it is exempt from E0810 and skipped by the composite width in both passes? That is this design's default, and it ends C19's order dependence. Or is it typed by its suffix everywhere, which makes `a + 5i32` E0810?
4. **C and C++ header integer operands (C09).** Should E0810 classify `uint32_t`/`int32_t` header operands? Today `u32 a + cSigned` yields 4294967295. ADR-024 names only floating header operands, and #978 keeps C integers untyped. The default is to leave them untyped and file C09.
5. **Rule 10.4 between a ternary's two value arms** (a #1092 item). Should `c ? i : k` with `u32 i` and `f32 k` be E0810? The rulings do not cover it, so this design does not add it.
6. **ADR-024 text in C13.** May ADR-024 record the items listed in §8.6 as consequences of the 2026-09-26 rulings, with no new decision? This covers C00, C01, C29, register and bitmap fields, the C++ overload case, and the matrix cells.
