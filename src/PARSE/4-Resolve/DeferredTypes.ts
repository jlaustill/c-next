/**
 * 1.4 Resolve: settle the type names 1.3 Declare could not.
 *
 * Declare owns per-file facts, so for a bare `T` written inside a scope it can
 * only answer when this file declares the scope type. Otherwise the name is
 * either a global type or a scope type from an included file, and telling those
 * apart needs the set of scope types the whole PROGRAM declares -- a cross-file
 * fact, which is 1.4's to own.
 *
 * Declare records those sites as `TDeferredType`, carrying the identifier as
 * WRITTEN and the scope it was written in. That pair is the input ADR-057
 * needs, and recording it is what keeps the decision at the parse tree:
 * qualifying a resolved name later cannot work, because by then `global.Mode`
 * and a bare `Mode` are the same string.
 *
 * This is a REBUILD everywhere it can be. Every type-bearing field on a symbol
 * is `readonly`, so settling one means constructing a new symbol.
 *
 * `IScopeSymbol.functions` is the one exception, and it is a real one rather
 * than an oversight: it IS type-bearing, and `SymbolRegistry` caches the scope
 * object by path, so a rebuilt scope would leave the registry holding the
 * unsettled functions. That array is written in place, from the same memo the
 * rebuild uses, so both readers end up on one object.
