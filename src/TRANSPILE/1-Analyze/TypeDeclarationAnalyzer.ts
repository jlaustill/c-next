/**
 * A declared type whose own shape is invalid: E0893 (ADR-034), and an enum
 * member's value that is negative (E0894), has no value (E0909), overflows
 * (E0910) or leaves `i32` (E0911) -- ADR-017 "Member Values", #1669.
 *
 * #1531. Both rules were throws in 1.3 Declare's collectors, so each reached
 * the user as `1:0 Code generation failed: Error: ...` -- no code, no
 * position, and a prefix naming a pass that never saw the declaration. A
 * throw also stopped the run at the first offender, so a file declaring three
 * bad bitmaps reported one.
 *
 * 1.3 still records the facts: each field's width beside the bitmap's size,
 * and each member's value. This asks the one question of them, so a width or
 * a value is derived once, by its collector, and judged once, here.
 *
 * The declarations are read from the symbol table rather than the tree. That
 * is what makes a scope-declared bitmap or enum one of them with nothing
 * extra: 1.3 registers it under the file like any other.
