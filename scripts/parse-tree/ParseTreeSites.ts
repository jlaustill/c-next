/**
 * Issue #1317: the committed inventory of modules holding an ANTLR parse tree.
 *
 * `docs/architecture/README.md` makes the AST Tier 1 with a short lifetime and
 * rests the whole lifetime axis on one rule -- 1.3 consumes `ParsedFile` and
 * does not re-export it, so the tree is not reachable from any artifact a
 * downstream pass holds. Nothing enforced it.
 *
 * The population is NOT scanned here. It is read from the violations of
 * `parse-tree-confined-to-parser` in `.dependency-cruiser.cjs`, so the question
 * "what counts as holding a parse tree" has exactly one answer, in the rule,
 * rather than one in the rule and a second in a grep that must agree with it.
 * That second definition is the duplicate-path anti-pattern this project
 * forbids, and it would fail in the quiet direction: a rule and a scanner that
 * disagree leave a module gated by neither while both report green.
 *
 * Keyed on the MODULE, not on `file:line`. `output-throw-classification.md`
 * records what line citations cost -- adding one import shifts every later
 * citation down one and all 20 missed by exactly one (#1399) -- and a module
 * path moves only when the module does, which is a reviewable diff rather than
 * silent drift.
