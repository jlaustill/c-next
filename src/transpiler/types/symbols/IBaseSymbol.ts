   * (`ScopeUtils.identityOf`). Before this field existed every consumer
   * re-derived it, and they did not all derive it the same way: the chain-walking
   * encoder and the leaf-only ones agreed because the grammar admits no nested
   * scopes. #1285 called that a coincidence; ADR-016 makes it a decision, and a
   * permanent one. Computing it once is still the point -- agreement reached
   * separately at each site is a duplicate path whether or not the fact it rests
   * on can change.
   *

   *
   * The two sentences above name two different things, and they coincide for
   * every kind C emits as an identifier. They do not coincide for members.
   * A struct field is emitted `p.x`, a bitmap field as a bit position, a
   * register member as an offset -- none is ever spelled as a standalone C
   * identifier, so for `struct_field`, `bitmap_field` and `register_member`
   * this field is the INDEX KEY and nothing else. `SPoint__x` is what
   * distinguishes that field from `SOther__x` in a table; it is not a name any
   * generated file contains, and a consumer that emits one has misread this.
   *
   * `enum_member` is the exception among members: `EColor__RED` and
   * `Motor__EMode__HIGH` are real, and appear in the committed `.expected.h`
   * fixtures. Its identity is checkable against generated output; the other
   * three kinds' identities are checkable only against each other.

   * made the symbol graph unserializable -- `JsonCodec` recursed until the stack

   * unable to fire on a proxy chain, so the hang the guard existed to prevent was
   * reachable with the guard silent.
   *
   * A path cannot express a cycle, so neither defect is representable rather than
   * being guarded against. It is also the key `SymbolRegistry` already stores
   * scopes under, so the object is one lookup away wherever the mutable member
   * lists are genuinely needed.

   * expands a dotted component and drops empties, which is why replacing the
