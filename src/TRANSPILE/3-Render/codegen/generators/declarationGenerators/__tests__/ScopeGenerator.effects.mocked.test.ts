/**
 * #1445 review: the scope-member path FORWARDS a generator's effects.
 *
 * `processScopeMember`'s register arm calls the same generator the file-scope
 * caller reaches through `CodeGenWalker.invokeGenerator`, which applies its
 * effects. The arm used to return only `["", result.code]`, so one function had
 * two callers honoring opposite halves of its contract -- safe solely because
 * `RegisterGenerator` hardcodes `effects: []` today.
 *
 * That "safe solely because" is what makes the fix untestable against the real
 * generator: with `effects` always empty, no assertion can tell applying them
 * from dropping them, and the regression would return silently. So the
 * generator is MOCKED to return a non-empty effect -- the test is about the
 * wiring, not about which effects a register happens to raise.
 *
 * Isolated in a `.mocked.test.ts` because `vi.mock` is hoisted and would
 * otherwise replace `RegisterGenerator` for every case in the sibling file.
