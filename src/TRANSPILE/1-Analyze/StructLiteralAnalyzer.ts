/**
 * ADR-014 struct initializers: E0357.
 *
 * #1322. Two throws in `CodeGenerator._resolveStructInitializerTypeName`, both
 * reported as `1:0`, and one of them fired on valid code (#1277).
 *
 * ## One question, asked once
 *
 * A struct literal has no type of its own; the position it stands in supplies
 * one (`Point p <- { x: 1 }`). Where nothing does, nothing can say what struct
 * this is -- E0357. A bare `{ x: 1, y: 2 };` as an expression statement is the
 * only shape in the language that reaches it.
 *
 * ## E0356 is retired, with the syntax it rejected
 *
 * A second rule stood here: a WRITTEN type (`Point { x: 1 }`) where the
 * position already declared one was redundant. It had no reachable complement
 * -- every position that consumes a value declares a type, so the written form
 * was an error in all of them, and the one place it parsed was a bare
 * expression statement, where it built a compound literal and discarded it.
 * The grammar alternative is removed on the language owner's decision, which
 * makes `Point { x: 1 }` a parse error and leaves this rule with one question
 * rather than two.
 *
 * E0357's help therefore does not offer "write the type" as a remedy: there is
 * no type to write. The only remedy is to move the initializer somewhere a
 * type is declared.
 *
 * ## Why #1277 was a codegen bug and not this rule's business
 *
 * The "cannot infer" throw fired on three shapes that are perfectly valid:
 * `return { x: 1, y: 2 };` at file scope, the same inside a scope method, and
 * a `for` header's declaration. In each, a type WAS available and codegen
 * simply did not thread it -- the return path set an expected type only when
 * the return type was an enum, the `for` header set none at all, and the scope
 * method never recorded its return type. That is fixed at the three emission
 * sites, so the rule here sees a position that supplies a type and stays
 * silent. Relocating the throw without fixing them would have preserved a
 * rejection of valid code behind a fresh error code.
 *
 * The scope-method half was found by an invariant this card installed: a bare
 * enum member returned from a scope method reached `Internal:` rather than a
 * diagnostic, because 2.1 said the position established an enum type and
 * codegen disagreed. Two generators had open-coded the same four-step function
 * context and one was missing a line.
