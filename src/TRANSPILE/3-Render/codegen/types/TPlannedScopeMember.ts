/**
 * One member of an ADR-016 scope.
 *
 * ## Every member gets an entry, including the ones that emit nothing
 *
 * `adrLine` is recorded for each member before anything is rendered -- that is
 * ADR-016's own decision point, and #1241 puts it at the MEMBER's position so a
 * variable member and a function member land in different matrix contexts
 * rather than both crediting whichever line the `scope` keyword sits on.
 *
 * So a member the generator has nothing to emit for still appears here, as
 * `other`. Dropping it would silently un-occupy a scope-context cell in
 * `docs/scope-context-matrix.md`, which is a generated artifact no test
 * compares against a previous run -- the failure would be invisible.
 *
 * ## Why the renders are thunks
 *
 * The generator calls `setCurrentScope(name)` before it renders anything, and
 * every type name below resolves against that path: a bare `Flags` inside
 * `scope Chip` is `Chip__Flags`. A value rendered at plan time resolves against
 * the OUTER path instead and emits the wrong name, silently. That applies to
 * `planParameters` and `planRegister` as much as to the obvious ones -- they
 * resolve type names too.
