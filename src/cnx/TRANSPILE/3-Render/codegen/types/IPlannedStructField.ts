/**
 * One field of a struct declaration, reduced to what the generator asks of it.
 *
 * #1445 box 3: `StructGenerator` read a `StructMemberContext` for a name, a
 * type name, and three renders -- the C type, the dimensions written on the
 * type (`u8[16] data`) and the dimensions written after the name
 * (`u8 data[16]`). Whether a field is a callback is 2.2's decision
 * (`isCallback`); everything else it decides comes from `input.symbols` and
 * the generator's own rules.
 *
 * ## Four of the seven are thunks, and that is not ceremony
 *
 * Each of the four renders is CONDITIONAL in the generator, and each can
 * register effects on `CodeGenState`:
 *
 * - `renderCType` runs only for a non-callback field. A callback field is
 *   spelled with its typedef name, so resolving its type eagerly would
 *   register an effect for a type the struct never names.
 * - `renderZeroInitializer` runs only for an enum field -- the one
 *   non-callback field whose zero is not the aggregate's zero.
 * - both dimension renders run only on the branches that use them, and the
 *   regular branch skips them entirely when the symbols carry tracked
 *   dimensions.
 *
 * Handing over four rendered strings would emit every one of those effects for
 * every field, which is a change to the output rather than to its shape.
