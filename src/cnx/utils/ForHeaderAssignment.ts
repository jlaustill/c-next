/**
 * ADR-068 (E0715, #1647): which assignment forms a `for` header clause cannot
 * hold. A clause is one C expression, and three forms lower to more than one
 * statement: a slice (one write per element), any write to an atomic (an
 * LDREX/STREX loop or a PRIMASK section, ADR-049 Q4/Q7), and a bit write on a
 * float (through a union). ADR-068 also rejects a string copy, which since
 * #2207 is one `cnx_string_copy` call; #2234 asks whether it still should.
 *
 * One decision, read off the operand typer: 2.1 reports it as E0715, and the
 * header renderer asserts it, so neither derives it again. Which writes are
 * atomic is `AtomicOwner`'s answer, the one 2.2 plans the write's form from:
 * a bit or bitmap-field write to an atomic is a read-modify-write too (#2200),
 * and its written type, a bit, carries no `atomic` (#2155 review).
