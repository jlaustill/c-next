/**
 * ExternalDeclarationOracle — recover FULL external symbols (function signatures,
 * typedefs, opaque structs) from a set of C/C++ headers that cnext's normal,
 * per-header-standalone symbol collection could not resolve.
 *
 * Two things defeat standalone collection of framework headers:
 *  1. Include-order guards — FreeRTOS `task.h` opens with
 *     `#ifndef INC_FREERTOS_H / #error`, so it refuses to preprocess unless
 *     `FreeRTOS.h` ran first.
 *  2. The parser's twin failure modes on a single header:
 *     - RAW (unpreprocessed) text still contains function-attribute macros like
 *       FreeRTOS `PRIVILEGED_FUNCTION` (`void vTaskDelay(...) PRIVILEGED_FUNCTION;`)
 *       — the trailing token breaks the declaration, so `vTaskDelay` is lost.
 *     - FULLY preprocessed text inlines the header's entire transitive tree
 *       (e.g. `driver/twai.h` -> ~100KB of xtensa HAL); ANTLR error-recovery then
 *       skips tokens in the blob and silently drops later declarations.
 *
 * The fix is to preprocess the include set AS A TRANSLATION UNIT (predecessors
 * first) while KEEPING `#line` directives, then bucket the output BY SOURCE FILE.
 * Each header's own slice is macro-expanded (PRIVILEGED_FUNCTION is gone) yet
 * small (no inlined tree), so parsing it robustly yields full signatures. The
 * caller parses each slice with cnext's real header parser, so recovered symbols
 * carry their full types — codegen needs these to pass structs by address
 * (`twai_driver_install(&cfg)`) and treat opaque types as pointers
 * (`lv_obj_t` -> `lv_obj_t *`).
 *
 * Function-like macros (e.g. `pdMS_TO_TICKS`) have no declaration to parse, so
 * their NAMES are collected separately (`-dM`) for the undeclared-call check
 * only — a by-value macro invocation is already correct.
 *
 * Requires a toolchain that can preprocess the target's headers; for cross
 * targets (ESP32/xtensa) set CNEXT_CROSS_COMPILER.
