/**
 * Reads a failed `execFileSync` / `execSync` / promisified `execFile` from the
 * `unknown` its `catch` receives.
 *
 * Every caller needs the same three facts -- the captured streams and the exit
 * status -- and each used to assert them into existence with its own inline
 * cast (`error as { stderr?: string; ... }`), each in its own shape, or reach
 * them through `any`. This narrows instead of asserting: a field is read
 * only if the value has it, as text, so a non-Error throw or a Buffer stream
 * is handled rather than assumed away (#1489).
 *
 * Which stream a caller reports first stays with the caller. That is the tool's
 * policy -- flawfinder writes findings to stdout, cppcheck to stderr -- not a
 * fact about the failure.
