# Start Issue — Begin Work on a Chosen c-next Issue

The single begin-work procedure for this repository. Two entry points reach it:

- **Directly** — "start on #1234", when the issue is already chosen.
- **From `issue-check`** — its Phase 6 hands off here once the user picks an issue.

There is deliberately no second copy of these steps. `issue-check` used to own them
(its Phase 6) and now delegates; adding the branch rules or the routing back into that
file would recreate the duplicate code path CLAUDE.md calls the project's worst
anti-pattern (#1423).

> **What this skill exists to stop.** Before it, nothing ever assigned an issue, so the
> board's `WIP` column had been empty since it was created — zero open issues assigned,
> zero cards in `WIP`, with the `issues.assigned → WIP` automation in
> `.github/workflows/project-sync.yml` sitting correct and unfired. Work went
> `Grooming`/`Backlog` → `Done`, and `issue-check`'s assignee-based in-flight detection
> could never find anything. Phase 1 is the whole point of the skill; the rest is the
> procedure that used to live elsewhere.

## Execution Workflow

Run these phases in order. **Phase 2 blocks** — do not read code, create a branch, or
start work until the board is confirmed.

---

### Phase 0: Resolve the Issue Number

```
EXTRACT the issue number from the user's message ("start on #1234" → 1234).

IF no number is present or more than one is:
  ASK which issue. Do not guess, and do not pick the largest or most recent.

STORE: ISSUE = <number>, OWNER_REPO = jlaustill/c-next
```

---

### Phase 1: Assign — FIRST, before reading anything

Assignment is what moves the card. It happens before the deep read so that the board
reflects the work from the moment it starts, not from whenever the reading finishes.

```bash
# Confirm the issue is open and see who, if anyone, already holds it.
gh api repos/jlaustill/c-next/issues/<ISSUE> \
  --jq '{state, assignees: [.assignees[].login], title}'
```

```
IF state is "closed":
  STOP. Say so. A closed issue is not started — "closed is closed"
  (docs/WORKFLOW.md), and a defect found after the fix shipped is a NEW issue.

IF assignees already contains someone else:
  STOP and ask. Someone is on it. Do not co-assign silently.

IF assignees already contains jlaustill:
  Already assigned. Skip the write, go to Phase 2 and verify the board anyway —
  a previous attempt may have assigned without the card moving.
```

```bash
gh issue edit <ISSUE> --add-assignee jlaustill

# Fallback — `gh issue` subcommands are unreliable in this repo (CLAUDE.md).
# Use the REST endpoint if the above fails:
gh api -X POST repos/jlaustill/c-next/issues/<ISSUE>/assignees \
  -f "assignees[]=jlaustill"
```

```bash
# Confirm the write landed before waiting on anything downstream.
gh api repos/jlaustill/c-next/issues/<ISSUE> --jq '[.assignees[].login] | join(",")'
```

---

### Phase 2: Verify the Board Reached WIP — BLOCKING

`project-sync.yml` maps `issues.assigned → WIP`. It is a **GitHub Actions run**, so it
completes seconds to minutes after the assignment, not instantly. Re-query the board
and report the value you actually read (CLAUDE.md, "Reported State — Re-query, Never
Restate"): asserting `WIP` because you assigned is exactly the failure that rule names.

```bash
# Poll until the card reaches WIP, or ~5 minutes elapse.
# --paginate is REQUIRED: the board is past 200 items and items(first: 100)
# truncates silently, which reads as "not on the board".
deadline=$((SECONDS+300))
q='query($endCursor: String) { user(login: "jlaustill") { projectV2(number: 1) {
  items(first: 100, after: $endCursor) {
    pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
    nodes {
      content { ... on Issue { number } }
      fieldValues(first: 20) { nodes {
        ... on ProjectV2ItemFieldSingleSelectValue {
          name field { ... on ProjectV2FieldCommon { name } } } } }
    } } } } }'
while [ $SECONDS -lt $deadline ]; do
  s=$(gh api graphql --paginate -f query="$q" \
    --jq '.data.user.projectV2.items.nodes[]
          | select(.content.number == <ISSUE>)
          | [.fieldValues.nodes[]|select(.field.name=="Status")|.name][0] // "unset"' \
    2>/dev/null | head -1)
  echo "#<ISSUE> board status: ${s:-<not on board>}"
  [ "$s" = "WIP" ] && { echo "REACHED WIP"; exit 0; }
  sleep 15
done
echo "TIMED OUT without reaching WIP"; exit 1
```

Run it with `run_in_background` so the wait does not block the tool call itself, then
**wait for its result before Phase 3.**

```
INTERPRET the final status. Three outcomes, and they are NOT the same:

  WIP
    → Correct. Proceed to Phase 3.

  "Changes Needed" | "Ready to Merge" | "PR Review" | "Done"
    → The automation DECLINED ON PURPOSE. project-sync.yml only overwrites
      `unset|Grooming|Backlog`, because it must never drag a card backwards.
      This is correct behavior, not a failure. Say which status it is and why the
      card was left alone, then ask whether to continue — a card in `Done` or
      `PR Review` usually means the work is already under way or finished.

  unset | Grooming | Backlog | <not on board>, after the timeout
    → The automation FAILED. Report it as a failure and STOP.
      Likely causes, in order:
        - PROJECT_TOKEN expired. It is a classic PAT with the `project` scope;
          GITHUB_TOKEN cannot write Projects v2.
        - The workflow run errored. Check it:
              gh run list --workflow=project-sync.yml --limit 5
              gh run view <id> --log-failed
        - The board has no `WIP` option (see docs/WORKFLOW.md).
```

**NEVER write the Status field by hand to "fix" this.** `project-sync.yml` is the sole
owner of that transition. A second writer is the duplicate code path again, and it would
mask the broken automation for every future issue instead of surfacing it once here.

---

### Phase 3: Blocked Check

`issue-check` refuses to recommend a blocked issue. Naming an issue directly bypasses
that filter, so the check is repeated here — otherwise this entry point silently loses
a guard the other one has.

```bash
# The `Blocked by` field for this one issue.
gh api graphql --paginate -f query='
query($endCursor: String) { user(login: "jlaustill") { projectV2(number: 1) {
  items(first: 100, after: $endCursor) {
    pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
    nodes {
      content { ... on Issue { number } }
      fieldValues(first: 20) { nodes {
        ... on ProjectV2ItemFieldTextValue {
          text field { ... on ProjectV2FieldCommon { name } } } } }
    } } } } }' \
  --jq '.data.user.projectV2.items.nodes[] | select(.content.number == <ISSUE>) |
        [.fieldValues.nodes[]|select(.field.name=="Blocked by")|.text][0] // ""'
```

```
`Blocked by` is a PERMANENT RECORD of what the work waited on, never a live state.
It is NEVER cleared and NEVER replaced — a new blocker is appended beside the old.
Blocked-ness is DERIVED, never read off the field's emptiness.

IF the field is non-empty:
  EXTRACT every #NNNN it names and resolve each:
      gh api repos/jlaustill/c-next/issues/<n> --jq '.state'

  THEN read what remains once the references are removed, and judge whether it
  ANNOTATES a named issue — "(PR5-PR7)", "(symbol model: sourceColumn)" — or names
  a FURTHER blocker of its own, "plus the naming decision". Both shapes are on the
  board today.

  any named issue still open
    → STOP. Name the open blockers and the verbatim qualifier, and ask whether to
      proceed anyway. The user may overrule; you may not overrule silently.

  all named issues closed, remaining text only annotates them
    → Not blocked. Say "unblocked (was: #1316, #1321 — both closed)" so the reader
      can see the field was read rather than ignored. Change nothing.
```

---

### Phase 4: Dedup Gate

```bash
git log --oneline --grep="<ISSUE>"
```

```
IF commits reference this issue:
  WARN that it may already be done; show the commits and confirm before continuing.
  A commit names an issue before it fixes one, so this is a prompt to look, not proof.
```

---

### Phase 5: Deep Read

```bash
# gh issue view may fail in this repo — use the API directly (CLAUDE.md).
gh api repos/jlaustill/c-next/issues/<ISSUE> \
  --jq '{title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], milestone: .milestone.title, created_at, state}'

gh api repos/jlaustill/c-next/issues/<ISSUE>/comments \
  --jq '.[] | {author: .user.login, created: .created_at, body}'
```

---

### Phase 6: Create the Branch

```
NEVER work on main. Create a feature branch first:
  bug / validation-bug         → fix/<ISSUE>-short-description
  enhancement / feature        → feature/<ISSUE>-short-description
  documentation / ADR          → docs/<ISSUE>-short-description
  test-coverage                → test/<ISSUE>-short-description
```

---

### Phase 7: Route by Issue Type

```
CLASSIFY the issue:
  BUG → Phase 7a (TDD workflow)
  ENHANCEMENT/FEATURE/OTHER → Phase 7b (ADR-first planning workflow)

Classification rules:
  - Has "bug", "validation-bug", or "MISRA Violations" label → BUG
  - Title starts with "Fix", "Bug:", "Broken" → BUG
  - Body contains "expected behavior" / "actual behavior" / "steps to reproduce" → BUG
  - Otherwise → ENHANCEMENT/FEATURE/OTHER
```

#### 7a: Bug → c-next TDD Workflow

```
FOR bugs, follow Test-Driven Development with c-next test conventions:

  1. ANALYZE the bug:
     - What is the expected behavior? What is the actual behavior?
     - What layer is affected? (data / logic / output / state — see CLAUDE.md architecture)

  2. WRITE A FAILING TEST FIRST as a .test.cnx with the correct marker:
     - Compile-error bug      → // test-error  + a .expected.error file
     - Wrong runtime behavior → // test-execution (validate every result, unique return codes)
     - Wrong generated code   → .expected.c / .expected.cpp / .expected.h snapshot
     - Place reproduction under tests/ (or tests/bugs/issue-<name>/ for regression cases)
     - Run it (npm test -- <path>) and confirm it FAILS with a useful message

  3. MUTATION-CHECK the test: presence is not proof. A fixture that cannot fail when
     the fix is reverted is not a regression test (#1222).

  4. PRESENT THE PLAN:
     "Here's the failing test that proves the bug. Here's my plan to fix it: ..."

  5. WAIT for user approval before implementing the fix.

  6. After approval, implement the fix UPSTREAM (never work around c-next bugs) and verify:
     - The previously failing test now passes
     - npm run test:gate is green — test:all is four checks of twenty-four
     - Commit generated .test.c / .test.h files — they are part of the suite
```

#### 7b: Enhancement/Feature → ADR-First Planning Workflow

```
FOR non-bug issues, research first (CLAUDE.md "Workflow: Research First"):

  1. ANALYZE the requirement and find the relevant ADR(s) in docs/decisions/.
     Only reference Accepted/Implemented ADRs as working syntax.

  2. EXPLORE the codebase for relevant files, patterns, and integration points.
     Respect layer constraints (logic/ cannot import from output/, transitively).

  3. UPDATE the ADR with research findings, links, and context as you go.
     NEVER change an ADR's Status or Decision without explicit user approval.
     An ADR must still pass the rewrite test — no src/** paths, no module lists.

  4. PRESENT THE PLAN:
     "Scope / files to modify / approach / testing strategy / ADR impact"

  5. WAIT for user approval before implementing.
```

---

### Phase 8: Announce on the Issue

```bash
gh issue comment <ISSUE> --body "Starting work. Approach: <brief plan>"
```

```
THROUGHOUT the work:
  ON progress:      gh issue comment <ISSUE> --body "Progress: <done / next>"
  WHEN opening PR:  reference the issue ("Fixes #<ISSUE>" / "Closes #<ISSUE>")
                    All changes go through a PR. Merge with a merge commit — NEVER squash.
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **DO NOT** read code, create a branch, or start work before Phase 2 confirms the
  board. The assignment is the point of this skill; doing the work first and assigning
  afterwards is how `WIP` stayed empty for the life of the board
- **DO NOT** report the card as moved because you assigned it. `project-sync.yml` is an
  async workflow run — re-query and report the status you read
- **DO NOT** write the board's Status field by hand. `project-sync.yml` owns that
  transition; a second writer is a duplicate code path and hides a broken automation
- **DO NOT** treat "left at Changes Needed" as a failure — the guard declining to drag a
  card backwards is correct behavior. Tell the two cases apart before reporting either
- **DO NOT** clear a `Blocked by`, replace what it names, or propose either — it is a
  permanent record, and a blocker that has closed is history, not a stale value
- **DO NOT** start on an issue whose `Blocked by` names something still open without
  saying so and getting an explicit override
- **DO NOT** start on a closed issue, or reopen one. A defect found after the fix
  shipped is a new issue with its own reproduction
- **DO NOT** skip the dedup gate — issues are sometimes already resolved
- **DO NOT** skip the failing-test step for bugs, or accept a fixture you have not
  mutation-checked
- **DO NOT** work around a c-next bug downstream — fix it upstream in the transpiler
- **DO NOT** change C-Next syntax/behavior or an ADR's Status without explicit approval
- **DO NOT** copy these phases back into `issue-check`. It delegates here on purpose
- **DO NOT** squash-merge — always use a merge commit
