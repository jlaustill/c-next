/**
 * How an ADR-016 scope member that declares a VARIABLE is emitted.
 *
 * Every scope variable is emitted at file scope under a scope-qualified C name,
 * with visibility deciding linkage. The three arms are the three shapes that
 * takes, and which one applies is decided from the declaration alone -- so the
 * choice is made once, here, and the renderer does not re-derive it.
 *
 * ## The `skipped` arm is why this is a union rather than a nullable record
 *
 * Issue #282 inlines a PRIVATE CONST SCALAR at its use sites instead of
 * emitting it, and Issue #500 exempts arrays because an array cannot be
 * inlined. A skipped member must render NOTHING -- not even its type --
 * because rendering a type registers an include: a file whose only `u32` is a
 * skipped private const would otherwise gain `#include <stdint.h>` for a
 * declaration that never appears. Stating the skip as an arm with no renders
 * on it makes that structural instead of a rule to remember.
