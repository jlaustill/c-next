/**
 * One ADR-025 case label, reduced to which grammar alternative matched and
 * what it carries.
 *
 * #1445 box 3: `SwitchGenerator` asked a `CaseLabelContext` six questions in a
 * fixed order -- qualified type, identifier, integer, hex, binary, char -- and
 * took the first that answered. That order IS the discrimination, so the union
 * states it and the planner picks the arm in the same order.
 *
 * The three numeric arms stay distinct because they are rendered differently:
 * a binary literal is converted to hex (Issue #114, through `BigInt` so a
 * value above 2^53 keeps its precision), and a char literal is the one that
 * ignores a leading minus -- `'-'` is not a negative character.
