/**
 * ArrayDimensionText - extracts array dimensions from a type or declarator
 * string.
 *
 * Issue #1127: `SymbolUtils.parseArrayDimensions` and
 * `TypeResolver.parseArrayType` each did this, and disagreed:
 *
 *   "[0x10]"   SymbolUtils "0x10"   TypeResolver 0     parseInt("0x10", 10)
 *   "[8+1]"    SymbolUtils "8+1"    TypeResolver 8     stops at '+'
 *   "[8ul]"    SymbolUtils "8ul"    TypeResolver 8     stops at 'u'
 *
 * TypeResolver's readings are not merely different, they are wrong: a 16-byte
 * array read as dimension 0, and `8+1` read as 8. Both now use this, which
 * folds through `LiteralUtils.parseIntegerLiteral` so every integer notation
 * resolves, and otherwise keeps the source text rather than truncating it.
 *
 * This is the string-level counterpart to `ArrayDimensionParser`, which works
 * from the parse tree. Two entry points exist because C and C++ declarators
 * reach the symbol layer as text, with no C-Next parse tree behind them.
 *
 * ## An unsized `[]` now yields an entry
 *
 * Both replaced implementations matched `[^\]]+` -- one or more -- so `[]`
 * produced *no* entry and an unsized array was indistinguishable from a
 * non-array. This yields `""`, so `extern unsigned char buf[]` and a flexible
 * array member now reach the C and C++ symbol layers as arrays of one unsized
 * dimension rather than as scalars.
 *
 * ## `""` is not `UNRESOLVED_DIMENSION`
 *
 * They describe different facts and must not be merged:
 *
 * - `""` -- the source declares NO size (`u8[]`). A fact about the
 *   declaration, and the dimension renders back as `[]`, which is valid C for
 *   an extern or a flexible array member.
 * - `UNRESOLVED_DIMENSION` -- the source declares a size that could not be
 *   folded here. A fact about resolution, in a numeric list, where it means
 *   "cannot bounds-check this subscript".
 *
 * Collapsing them would make an unsized array look like a resolution failure,
 * or a resolution failure look like a deliberate `[]` in the emitted C.
