/**
 * Issue #1316: the committed manifest of fixtures that assert a diagnostic.
 *
 * A `.expected.error` is the only assertion that a diagnostic fires, and nothing
 * noticed one going away. Under `--update` the harness unlinked it and reported
 * the run green; by hand it is a deleted file, which reads as tidying. Either way
 * a lost diagnostic and an intentional fix were indistinguishable -- on the one
 * command a diagnostic migration runs repeatedly, across 287 fixtures.
 *
 * Modes are write / check, following `scripts/adr-matrix.ts`: `check`
 * regenerates in memory, diffs against what is committed, AND reports shrinkage.
