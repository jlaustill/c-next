# C-Next Project Instructions

## Task Completion Requirements

**A task is NOT complete until all relevant documentation is updated:**

- `README.md` — Must reflect any new features, syntax, or ADR status changes
- `docs/decisions/adr-*.md` — Relevant ADR must be created/updated
- `docs/learn-cnext-in-y-minutes.md` — Must include examples of new syntax/features
- memory is updated

If implementing a feature, all three documents must be current and memory must be updated before the task is done.

## ADR Status Rules

**CRITICAL: NEVER change an ADR status without explicit user confirmation.**

- ADR status values: Research, Accepted, Implemented, Rejected
- An ADR is not "Accepted" until the user explicitly accepts it
- An ADR is not "Implemented" until the user confirms implementation is complete
- Always ask before changing status, no exceptions
