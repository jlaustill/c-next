# Architecture Decision Records — Numbering

This folder holds every C-Next Architecture Decision Record. This file governs **how ADRs are
numbered**; [`../architecture-decisions.md`](../architecture-decisions.md) is the companion
index that lists them **by status**.

> This is not the repository root `README.md`. CLAUDE.md's rule _"Sync order: Update ADR file
> FIRST, then README.md"_ refers to the root `README.md`, not this file.

## The rule

**An ADR's number band is the release it must ship in.**

Band `N` holds the work performed during `vN.x`. Cutting `v(N+1)` requires that **every** ADR in
band `N` is fully implemented **and properly tested** — which means it has declared a
scope-context matrix, and every cell it declared `error` is occupied. A band is therefore a
commitment about testing as much as about features, not a label.

**Declared** is the load-bearing word. Undeclared cells default to `off`, so an ADR with no
matrix at all is indistinguishable from one claiming its feature cannot occur anywhere. That
satisfies a gate asking only about implementation, and satisfies nothing else.

Declaring `warn` on a cell that is not yet covered is a **met** obligation, not an unmet one,
provided the ADR says why and the follow-up is filed. Some ADRs cannot occupy an `error` cell at
all: the matrix derives a cell from a diagnostic's position, so an ADR governing generated-code
shape rather than a diagnostic has no way to occupy one until that tooling gap closes. Those
declare `warn` and reference the gap. Requiring `error` of them would be a gate nothing could
pass — which is why the obligation is to _declare honestly_, not to be green.

| Band  | Work performed during | Release gate                          | Allocated so far                                        |
| ----- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0xx` | v0.x                  | All must be implemented to cut **v1** | 001–058, 060–070 (011, 012, 048, 055, 060, 065 retired) |
| `1xx` | v1.x                  | All must be implemented to cut **v2** | 100–106, 111                                            |
| `2xx` | v2.x                  | All must be implemented to cut **v3** | none yet                                                |

### Choosing a band for a new ADR

Ask **"which release must this ship in?"** — not "when did I write it?" and not "what is the
next free number?". An ADR written today that is deliberately deferred until after v1 ships is
`1xx` work, even though it was filed during v0.x.

### Terminal statuses are exempt from the gate

`Rejected` and `Superseded` are terminal — such an ADR can never become "implemented", so it
never blocks a release. Every other status (`Research`, `Accepted`, `WIP`, `Implemented`) counts
toward its band's gate.

### Numbers are never reused

Gaps are intentional and permanent. `059` and `107` were never allocated; neither will be filled.
`053` was withdrawn on 2026-08-28 -- it described the transpiler's pipeline rather than deciding
anything about the language, so it did not meet the definition of an ADR. The number stays retired.

The same judgement, applied by the rewrite test rather than by eye, retired six more on
2026-08-31 (#1403). Each described how the transpiler or its toolchain is built rather than what
C-Next decides, so none would survive a rebuild in another stack. They were moved, not deleted:

| Retired | Moved to                                      | Was about                       |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `011`   | `docs/implementation/vscode-extension.md`     | the editor extension            |
| `012`   | `docs/implementation/static-analysis.md`      | running cppcheck over output    |
| `048`   | `docs/implementation/cli-distribution.md`     | npm packaging                   |
| `055`   | `docs/architecture/symbol-resolution.md`      | the symbol model's construction |
| `060`   | `docs/implementation/extension-separation.md` | splitting the extension repo    |
| `065`   | `docs/architecture/codegen-decomposition.md`  | splitting one generator class   |

A reference to any of these numbers -- in a source comment, the changelog, or an old issue --
resolves to the row above, and those references are deliberately **not** rewritten.
A retired number stays retired, so that an old issue or commit referencing it can never resolve
to a different decision than the one its author meant.

The rule binds from 2026-08-23, when it was first written down, so `046` and `051` are its two
exceptions — both were vacated on 2026-01-07 and refilled before it existed (`051` on
2026-01-10, `046` on 2026-01-19), which means a reference to either from before its refill date
means the decision the renumbering history maps it to, not the one holding the number today.

### Moving an ADR to a different band

When an ADR's target release changes, its number changes with it:

1. `git mv` the file to its new number, keeping the file stem.
2. Update **every** reference in the repository — docs, `src/`, `grammar/`, and `.test.cnx`
   fixture comments.
3. Regenerate test snapshots. ADR references inside `.test.cnx` comments are carried into
   generated `.c`/`.cpp` output by ADR-043 comment preservation, so `npm run test:update` is
   required and its diff must contain comment lines only.
4. Add a row to the renumbering history below.

Precedent: commit `a2277b87` (2026-01-07) moved ADR-051 → ADR-104 and ADR-046 → ADR-105 this way.

## Writing a new ADR

Start from [`TEMPLATE.md`](TEMPLATE.md). Copy it to `adr-NNN-short-stem.md`,
pick the band per the rule above, and fill in the sections — the guidance
comments explain what each one is for and delete as you go.

### The rewrite test

**If the transpiler were rebuilt from scratch in a different language and stack, every ADR must
still be fully applicable.** An ADR decides something about the C-Next language; it does not
record how today's TypeScript/ANTLR/Node implementation satisfies that decision.

**This table is the single source of truth for what that admits.** CLAUDE.md, `TEMPLATE.md` and
CONTRIBUTING.md state the test and link here; none of them repeats the list. That is deliberate:
the test is an invariant and restating it is harmless, but the list is derived from it and is
the part that will change, so it gets one home. The rule this replaces reached seven copies
before anyone noticed.

| In an ADR                                       | Not in an ADR                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| C-Next snippets; generated C/C++ snippets       | TypeScript/JavaScript source                   |
| EBNF grammar productions                        | ANTLR-only directives (`-> skip`, `channel()`) |
| Prior art in any language, including TS and JS  | `src/**` paths; transpiler class/method names  |
| Diagnostics, messages, the scope-context matrix | npm, `package.json`, CI config, tool commands  |
| Rejected alternatives and why                   | Phasing, checklists, migration plans           |

Implementation detail belongs in `docs/architecture/` (how the transpiler is structured) or
`docs/implementation/` (how one decision is carried out).

This is the rule that retired `053` above, generalized. That withdrawal judged a whole file;
the test judges a passage, which is what was needed — **40 of 76** ADRs had drifted past the
un-testable version of the rule, five of them filed after it was written down (#1403). A hand
audit of the same corpus found 29; the gate found the rest.

An ADR therefore **points at nothing in `src/`**. Its strongest citation is a fixture path: a
rewrite keeps the conformance corpus and discards every module name, and a fixture is the one
reference an ADR can hold that _fails_ when the decision it documents stops being true.
[ADR-063](adr-063-identifier-syntax.md) is the worked example.

### Sections

`Context`, `Decision`, and `References` appear in nearly every existing ADR and
the template treats them as required. Two sections are easy to skip and
expensive to skip:

- **Diagnostics** — every error code the ADR introduces, allocated in
  `docs/error-codes.md` in the same change. A code reserved and never allocated
  reads as implemented when it is not.
- **Scope-Context Matrix (#1219)** — required for any ADR whose behavior a
  fixture can observe. Undeclared cells default to `off`, so an ADR without a
  matrix is indistinguishable from one claiming its feature cannot occur
  anywhere, and nothing in the gate will tell you. `off` is a claim that a cell
  **cannot exist**, and it is reviewed as one.

The template carries the tooling limits and the two dimensions the axes cannot
see. [ADR-051](adr-051-division-by-zero.md) section 5 is the worked example,
including how it staged `warn` → `error` while a cell was known broken;
[ADR-070](adr-070-return-value-use.md) is the example of arguing rows to `off`
from the grammar.

## Renumbering history

GitHub issues and merged pull requests permanently reference the numbers that were current when
they were written. This table is how those references stay resolvable.

| Old     | New     | Title                       | When       | Why                                          |
| ------- | ------- | --------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| ADR-046 | ADR-105 | Prefixed Includes           | 2026-01-07 | Deferred to the v2 roadmap                   |
| ADR-051 | ADR-104 | ISR-Safe Queues             | 2026-01-07 | Deferred to the v2 roadmap                   |
| ADR-108 | ADR-064 | Volatile Keyword            | 2026-08-23 | v0 work mis-filed in the `1xx` band          |
| ADR-109 | ADR-065 | CodeGenerator Decomposition | 2026-08-23 | v0 work mis-filed in the `1xx` band          |
| ADR-110 | ADR-066 | DO-178C Compliance          | 2026-08-23 | Required for v1; mis-filed in the `1xx` band |
| ADR-112 | ADR-067 | All-Paths-Return            | 2026-08-23 | v0 work mis-filed in the `1xx` band          |
| ADR-113 | ADR-068 | Forever Loops               | 2026-08-23 | v0 work mis-filed in the `1xx` band          |
| ADR-114 | ADR-069 | Dead-Code / Reachability    | 2026-08-23 | Required for v1; mis-filed in the `1xx` band |
| ADR-115 | ADR-070 | Return-Value Use            | 2026-08-23 | Required for v1; mis-filed in the `1xx` band |

A changed file stem is not a renumbering and does not belong in this table. ADR-022 was
rewritten in place in commit `1f56e2d8` (`adr-022-ternary-operator.md` was replaced by
`adr-022-conditional-expressions.md`), but it kept its number, so nothing needed to be
remapped.

### Why the 2026-08-23 corrections were needed

ADRs 100–106 were created on 2026-01-04 as a deliberate v2 bucket, and `a2277b87` moved two more
ADRs into that bucket three days later. But the convention lived only in those commit messages,
so every ADR filed afterward (108, 109, 110, 112, 113, 114, 115) simply continued the integer
sequence and landed in the wrong band. Writing the rule down here — and in CLAUDE.md — is what
stops that from recurring.
