   * here, where it survived as `ISerializedSymbol` plus an adapter in each
   * direction. Because those adapters named fields one at a time, every fact
   * the symbol model gained had to be re-taught to them by hand — and four
   * bugs (#985, #1104, #1214, #1225) were fields nobody added.

   * through a generic encoder that never enumerates fields, so it cannot drop
   * one. Typed as JSON because that is what the file honestly holds until
   * `CachedSymbolReader` validates it.
