/**
 * Struct-parameter access helpers.
 *
 * ADR-006: Struct parameters need -> access (passed by pointer in C),
 *          or . access (passed by reference in C++)
 *
 * ## What used to be here, and why it is not
 *
 * #1445: this module also held `determineSeparator` and a 350-line generic
 * member-chain walker, `buildMemberAccessChain`, with eight private helpers.
 * Both were dead:
 *
 *   determineSeparator       0 production callers, 14 test callers
 *   buildMemberAccessChain   0 production callers, 17 test callers
 *
 * `buildMemberAccessChain`'s only two mentions outside its own tests were
 * PROSE -- `MemberChainAnalyzer`'s header said it "delegates to
 * buildMemberAccessChain to eliminate code duplication" while importing no
 * such thing. A reader who grepped for the delegation found something that
 * looked like confirmation and was not; both lines are corrected with this
 * deletion.
 *
 * This is the third instance of one defect. CLAUDE.md already records the
 * first -- `buildStructParamMemberAccess`, "no production caller ... and knip
 * could not report it, because its six test callers count as usage (#1418)",
 * deleted under #1450. knip cannot see these two either, and for a second
 * reason: they are members of an exported object literal, which the #1556
 * `include: ["classMembers"]` setting does not reach. Chains are built
 * incrementally by `MemberSeparatorResolver` and the postfix generator, never
 * in one call, so a general chain builder has never had a caller here.
 *
 * Deleting the walker is also what takes this module out of
 * `parse-tree-confined-to-parser`: its `ParseTree` import existed solely for
 * the `children` arrays the walker indexed, and the two helpers below name no
 * parse type at all.
