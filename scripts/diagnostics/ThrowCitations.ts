/**
 * Issue #1365: the throw classification cites every site by `file:line`, and a
 * line number decays silently.
 *
 * `docs/architecture/output-throw-classification.md` (#1321) is the input that
 * splits #1322. It names every throw site in `output/` by file and
 * line. #1362 committed it with correct citations; #1363 then added 62 lines to
 * `TypeValidator.ts`, and 64 of the 180 citations silently began pointing at a
 * docstring or a closing brace. Each pull request was green on its own -- one
 * never looked at the doc, the other ran before the code change existed -- and
 * `main` is unprotected (#1344), so nothing evaluated the pair.
 *
 * A line number cannot be replaced by the message text: `Error: 'this' can only
 * be used inside a scope` is thrown from nine distinct sites, so message text
 * does not identify one. `file:line` is the only unique key, which is why this
 * gate verifies it rather than the doc trading it for something softer.
 *
 * Five invariants, all mechanical:
 *
 *   1. every cited `file:line` is exactly a line opening a throw statement
 *   2. every throw under `output/` is cited exactly once
 *   3. every row's anchor is a substring of what the throw at its line says
 *   4. no two rows in one file could trade line numbers and keep 3 holding
 *   5. a `file:line` written in PROSE lands on a throw too
 *
 * The second is the one that earns its keep beyond drift: it fails when a new
 * throw is added and nobody classifies it, which is how `output/` grows a
 * rejection the Plan/Render boundary has not accounted for.
 *
 * The third is #1374. Two rows can trade line numbers within a file and the
 * first two invariants still hold -- each cited line is a throw, each throw
 * is cited once -- while both rows now describe the other's site, which is
 * exactly what #1322's delete-and-relocate work produces. So each row also
 * carries an anchor: a verbatim substring of the throw's argument, at least
 * `MIN_ANCHOR_LENGTH` characters, which the gate holds to the statement at
 * the cited line. The line stays the key and the anchor corroborates it:
 * identically-messaged sites keep identical anchors and stay interchangeable,
 * because the source makes no distinction between them either.
 *
 * The fourth is what makes the third a gate rather than an audit. An anchor
 * that clears the floor can still stop just short of the text that tells two
 * different throws apart, and then both rows corroborate both sites. Whether
 * a pair could trade is directly computable from the rows of a file, so it
 * is computed -- the #1374 review found three such pairs by hand; this finds
 * them mechanically, and the next ones #1322 adds.
 *
 * The fifth is #1322, and it exists because the asymmetry was measurable: the
 * 181 gated rows were at 0% drift while 14 of 59 PROSE citations had rotted,
 * each short by the same few lines an intervening edit had added. The rows were
 * accurate because something checked them; the prose was not because nothing
 * did. That mattered beyond tidiness -- the tier tables and the split that
 * sizes #1322's phases are prose, and the claim "only 2 of 181 sites emit a
 * real position" (the true figure is 20, with 12 more computing a position and
 * spending it on text) is what tier A was scoped from.
