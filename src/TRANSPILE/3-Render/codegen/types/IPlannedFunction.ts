 * body has to run first so the parameter list can see which parameters it
 * modified. Everything the generator read off the node it handed straight to
 * the orchestrator.
 *
 * So the values come over as values, and the two steps whose TIMING the
 * generator owns come over as thunks. A thunk here is not a node in disguise:
 * the generator cannot look inside one, which is the point -- it can only
 * decide when to run it.
