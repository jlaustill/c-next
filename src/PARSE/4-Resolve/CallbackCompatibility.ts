/**
 * Which functions are used as ADR-029 callbacks, across the whole program.
 *
 * A function assigned to a callback typedef must keep the typedef's parameter
 * shape, so it may not take #268 auto-const or ADR-006 pass-by-value. That makes
 * "is this function used as a callback?" a fact the generated signature depends
 * on — and the use can be in a different file from the declaration, so it is a
 * cross-file fact.
 *
 * It was accumulated instead. `FunctionCallAnalyzer` recorded it as a side
 * effect while analyzing each file during rendering, into a mutable static that
 * `CodeGenState.reset()` deliberately skipped so the entries would survive —
 * which means a file rendered early saw fewer callbacks than one rendered late,
 * and its signatures were decided on a partial answer. #1511 derived it over
 * every tree before anything renders, and #1452 removed the static.
 *
 * #1825: what remained was running that analyzer over every tree, diagnostics
 * discarded, for the map it filled as a side effect -- from the orchestration
 * layer, because `PARSE/` may not import `TRANSPILE/`. 1.3 now records where
 * each file names what may be a function (`CallbackUseCollector`), and the rule
 * that decides which of those uses is a callback is here, its one owner.
 *
 * #1544: a function is recognized wherever it is declared. Both recognition
 * rules once gated on the functions the USING file declares, so a callback
 * target in another file was missed and took ordinary parameter rules --
 * emitting a signature that no longer matched the typedef it was assigned to,
 * at transpile exit 0.
