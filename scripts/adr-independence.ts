 * Issue #1403: ADRs must survive a rewrite of the transpiler in another stack.
 *
 * The baseline this landed with is gone: it reached zero on 2026-08-31 and was
 * deleted with the branch that read it, so there is no longer any way to exempt an
 * ADR from the check. A gate that can be opted out of eventually is.
