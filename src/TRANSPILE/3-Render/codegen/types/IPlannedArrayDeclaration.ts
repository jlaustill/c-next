/**
 * The array half of a variable declaration (ADR-035/ADR-036).
 *
 * C-Next writes dimensions in the TYPE -- `u16[8] arr` -- and the grammar also
 * admits trailing `arrayDimension`s, so "is this an array" is the disjunction
 * of two places and both contribute text. That disjunction is decided here,
 * once, rather than re-asked at each of the four sites that used to ask it.
 *
 * ## What is eager, and the one that surprises
 *
 * `arrayTypeDimensions` is a STRING, not a thunk, and that is deliberate.
 * Rendering it can generate a dimension expression, and today it is rendered
 * unconditionally once `isArray` holds -- BEFORE the initializer branch chooses
 * whether to use it. One sub-branch (`hasEmptyArrayTypeDimension`, where size
 * inference has already produced the suffix) then discards it. Making it a
 * thunk would skip the render on exactly that sub-branch, which drops whatever
 * effects the dimension expression raised. Preserved as eager so the effects
 * are raised the same number of times.
 *
 * `renderCStyleDimensions` IS a thunk, for the mirror reason: today it runs
 * only on the branch that uses it.
