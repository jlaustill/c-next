/**
 * One register member's `#define`, decided (ADR-004).
 *
 * #1445 box 3: this is what `RegisterMacroGenerator` actually consumed out of
 * a `RegisterMemberContext` -- four strings per member and nothing else. It
 * named the grammar in order to call `.IDENTIFIER().getText()`,
 * `.accessModifier().getText()` and two orchestrator round-trips, then threw
 * the node away. Naming the four answers instead is what lets the formatter be
 * a pure function of them.
 *
 * `cType` and `offset` arrive ALREADY RENDERED, and that is deliberate rather
 * than a shortcut: `cType` is the output of `orchestrator.generateType`, which
 * is the single ADR-057 resolution point for the name -- it qualifies a bare
 * `Flags` to the enclosing scope's bitmap and leaves an explicit
 * `global.Flags` alone. Carrying the resolved string means nothing downstream
 * can re-qualify it, which is the defect ADR-057 forbids and which this pair
 * of generators has already had once.
 *
 * `access` is `TRegisterAccessMode`, not `string`. The parse node's
 * `.accessModifier().getText()` is a bare `string`, so the narrowing has to
 * happen at whichever boundary builds this -- and it has to happen here,
 * because `RegisterMacroGenerator` decides `const` on `access === "ro"` and a
 * `string` lets `"r0"` or an unhandled sixth modifier through that comparison
 * into a writable `#define` for a read-only register, with nothing failing.
 * `TRegisterAccessMode`'s own header records the same lesson from #1450, and
 * `RegisterCollector` already narrows at its boundary the same way.
