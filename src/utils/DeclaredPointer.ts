 * #1668: whether a declaration is a C pointer though C-Next spelled its type

 *
 * A declaration whose C type is already a pointer (ADR-046's `cstring` is
 * `char*`) is one. Otherwise three arms decide, in order (they were
 * `CodeGenWalker._inferVariableType`'s):
 *
 * 1. #958: a C header's typedef struct is always handled through a pointer.
 * 2. #895 Bug B: an initializer that calls a C function returning `T*`, for a
 *    declared `T`, makes the variable a `T*`.
 * 3. ADR-046: a `c_`-prefixed variable initialized from one of the C library
 *    functions that return a struct pointer.
