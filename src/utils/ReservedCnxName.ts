 * ReservedCnxName - the single source of truth for names the transpiler invents.
 *
 * ADR-063 part 2 reserves the `cnx_` prefix, compared case-insensitively, for
 * every name that corresponds to no user declaration: temporaries, the strlen
 * cache, overflow helpers, include guards. A user identifier may not begin with
 * it (E0202), which is what makes the transpiler's namespace and the user's
 * disjoint.
 *
 * Before this module each family spelled its own convention — `_tmp<N>`,
 * `_<var>_len`, `_cnx_tmp_<N>`, `cnx_clamp_*`, `<BASENAME>_H` — and three of the
 * five chose shapes a user could declare. Issue #1131 verified the consequence:
 * a user global `_msg_len` was shadowed by the generated strlen cache and every
 * later read silently bound to the wrong storage, with a clean `-Wall -Wextra`
 * compile and exit 0. Route all invented names through here.
 *
 * NOT for qualified user names (`Scope__member`). Those are built by
 * QualifiedCName, and the two must not be confused: `__` asserts "qualified user
 * name, component boundary here", which a temporary has no business claiming.
