/**
 * MemberChainAnalyzer - Analyzes member access chains for bit access patterns
 *
 * Issue #644: Extracted from CodeGenerator to reduce file size.
 *
 * Used to detect bit access at the end of member chains, e.g.:
 * - grid[2][3].flags[0] - detects that [0] is bit access on flags
 * - s.arr[1][3] - detects that [3] is bit access on an array field's element
 *
 * ## It reads the typer's chain, not its own (#1668, C12)
 *
 * What the final subscript indexes is the one operand typer's answer: the
 * last step of the target's chain says the type before the subscript and the
 * subscript's kind, as 2.1's bit rules and the read path already read them.
 * This class walked the chain itself, through the render state's struct
 * fields, with its own count of how many subscripts an array field takes. That
 * count was wrong for an element of an array field, so `s.arr[1][3] <- true`
 * was emitted as `s.arr[1][3] = true;`, and it knew only C-Next integer names,
 * so a C header's `uint8_t` field was never a bit target. What is left here is
 * the decision; the write itself is `AssignmentHandlerUtils.writeBits`, the
 * one every bit handler uses (#1668 review: this class rendered the base
 * from the source spelling, so a renamed local wrote the global it shadows).
