## ADR Status Rules

**CRITICAL: NEVER change an ADR status without explicit user confirmation.**

- ADR status values: Research, Accepted, Implemented, Rejected
- An ADR is not "Accepted" until the user explicitly accepts it
- An ADR is not "Implemented" until the user confirms implementation is complete
- Always ask before changing status, no exceptions
