/**
 * 2.2 Plan -- every type name a file's public header will name.
 *
 * ## Why this is one function and not two predicates
 *
 * "Which types does this header name?" was derived twice, and both derivations
 * stopped in the same place: at functions and variables (#1520).
 *
 *   `Transpiler._headerNeedsUserCHeaders` branched on `symbol.kind`, handled
 *   `variable` and `function`, and answered `false` for a struct -- so a struct
 *   never asked for the header defining its FIELD's type.
 *
 *   `HeaderGeneratorUtils.collectExternalTypes` walked function returns,
 *   function parameters and variables, and had no struct-field loop.
 *
 * Four `tests/issue-502` headers declared `SeaDash::Parse::ParseResult result;`
 * and included nothing that defines it. Patching one derivation would have left
 * the other wrong, which is why the enumeration moved here instead: a type the
 * header names is a fact about the symbols, and it has one answer.
 *
 * ## It enumerates; it does not judge
 *
 * Whether a name is a builtin, local, forward-declarable or needs an include
 * are all different questions with different answers, asked by different
 * callers. Deciding any of them here would put a second question in a function
 * that answers one -- and it is exactly how the `::` skip came to serve two
 * masters, right for "can this be forward-declared" and wrong for "does this
 * need an include".
