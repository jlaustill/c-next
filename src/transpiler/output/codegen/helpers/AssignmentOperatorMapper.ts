/**
 * ADR-001: the one place a C-Next assignment operator becomes its C form.
 *
 * #1322 unified the TABLE -- a byte-identical `ASSIGNMENT_OPERATOR_MAP` had
 * stood in `CodeGenerator` beside the shared one. What stayed duplicated was
 * the DECISION: `getText()`, the lookup, and the `|| "="` fallback were
 * rewritten at three call sites (`AssignmentContextBuilder`, and both the
 * `forAssignment` and `forUpdate` paths in `ControlFlowGenerator`). CLAUDE.md
 * counts that separately from the data -- "single source of truth means the
 * _decision_" -- and three copies of a fallback diverge silently.
 *
 * #1585 is what forced it: ADR-001 needs a provenance site for its assignment
 * half, and adding one to each of three sites would have been a fourth thing
 * to keep in step. One decision, one recording.
 *
 * #1588: a lookup miss is an INVARIANT, not a fallback. `|| "="` returned a
 * wrong answer rather than a missing one -- `i +<- 1` became `i = 1`, which in
 * a `for` update is an infinite loop in generated firmware, emitted at exit 0
 * with no diagnostic.
 *
 * It is `invariant()` and not `throw new`, per #1322b: the map and the grammar
 * are two halves of one fact, so a miss means the transpiler is wrong, not the
 * author's program. A `throw new` here would also rejoin the `output/` corpus
 * that #1322 emptied -- bucket 2 of `output-throw-classification.md` is exactly
 * this shape, and all sixteen of its sites became assertions for that reason.
 * `scripts/__tests__/assignment-operator-parity.test.ts` catches the divergence
 * at its source; this catches it at the point of use.
