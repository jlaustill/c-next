 * A C-Next type, reduced to what 2.3 Render asks of it.

 * #1445: `TypeGenerationHelper` used to take a `TypeContext` and re-walk the
 * six type alternatives itself. That was the seventh ladder #1285 set out to
 * collapse -- `TypeBinding`'s own header names this helper as one of the seven
 * -- and it was still standing. The named branches come from that one ladder
 * now, so the renderer receives a classification instead of re-deriving one.
 *
 * The three non-named alternatives stay separate fields rather than joining
 * the union, because 1.3 Declare and 2.3 Render want DIFFERENT answers for
 * them: `TypeBinding.resolveStringType` yields `string<32>`, where the
 * renderer wants `char`; `resolveNamedOrPrimitiveType` yields a primitive's
 * written name, where the renderer wants it through `TYPE_MAP`. Folding them
 * in would force one of the two to re-derive, which is the thing this replaces.
