/**
 * Issue #1143: Stable identity of one toolchain requirement.
 *
 * Keys are **per-arm, not per-feature**. The IRQ-wrapper block emits four
 * platform arms in one #if/#elif/#else chain, and each arm depends on a
 * different platform library -- ARMv7-M, Arduino, avr-libc, CMSIS. Collapsing
 * them into one "critical section" key is what makes a requirements table lie:
 * it forces a single answer to a question whose answer is per-target.
 *
 * The union is closed, and TOOLCHAIN_REQUIREMENTS is a Record over it, so
 * adding a key without adding its registry entry is a compile error.
