/**
 * Lifts the plain member records mocks used to write into member SYMBOLS.
 *
 * Struct fields, bitmap fields and register members became symbols in #1318,
 * so each one a mock builds now needs nine more fields. These helpers WRAP the
 * existing literal rather than replacing it, so a test that was about header
 * emission stays about header emission instead of turning into a test about
 * symbol identity.
 *
 * Identity comes from `ScopeUtils.identityOf` -- the same encoder
 * `MemberSymbolBase` uses in production -- so a mock cannot assert a key the
 * real collector would never produce. Spans are distinct per member, so a test
 * claiming a member reports its OWN position cannot pass by coincidence.

   * on the production side, reintroduced on the mock side, where a tenth field
   * on `IBaseSymbol` would have meant editing both and the two would have
   * drifted silently because different tests exercise each.
