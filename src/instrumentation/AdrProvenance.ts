/**
 * Issue #1241: records where an ADR's rule fired during transpilation.
 *
 * Occupancy of the scope-context matrix is derived from source POSITIONS. A
 * diagnostic supplies one; a codegen decision did not, so ADRs governing
 * successful resolution (ADR-016, ADR-057) had fixtures that could never occupy
 * a cell -- the gate read `warn` for seventeen cells that eleven fixtures were
 * already exercising. That is an observability gap, not a coverage gap, and
 * writing more fixtures could not have closed it.
 *
 * Deliberately a plain sink, not a decision-maker: it records that a rule fired
 * at a position and answers nothing about which cell that is. Classification
 * stays in the matrix tooling, walking the parse tree, so provenance cannot
 * drift from the fixture the way a declared cell can.
 *
 * The current file lives here rather than being passed at every call. A
 * recording site is a one-liner inside a decision it is already making, and
 * threading a path through helpers that deliberately take injected deps
 * (TypeGenerationHelper) would have made those helpers know about global state
 * purely to report on themselves.
 *
 * ## #1452, and what this module does NOT satisfy
 *
 * It moved out of `src/transpiler/state/` for box 1, and it does not satisfy
 * box 4 -- "no module reachable from the pipeline holds mutable cross-pass
 * state". It holds two mutable statics, written at 17 `record` sites across
 * 2.1 Analyze and 2.3 Render plus four `beginFile` sites, and read once at the
 * end of the run. That is cross-pass by the box's literal text.
 *
 * Neither alternative is better. Splitting the sink per pass yields three
 * accumulators where there is one, and the only consumer
 * (`scripts/matrix/AdrProvenanceLines.ts`) reads `adr` and `line` and never
 * `sourcePath`, so the attribution a split changes is unobservable to the only
 * gate watching it. Threading an instance through the call sites contradicts
 * the paragraph above, which is a recorded design decision, not an oversight.
 *
 * The owner's call, taken 2026-09-23: box 4 governs PROGRAM state. A fact about
 * the run is not one, so `src/instrumentation/` is admitted by
 * `docs/architecture/README.md` as a fourth kind of root beside the layers, the
 * shared contracts and the host -- and as the one root that may hold mutable
 * state, because what it accumulates is an observation rather than a fact
 * carried between passes. Nothing downstream branches on it.
 *
 * That exemption is stated, not incidental. `passes-hold-no-mutable-state.test.ts`
 * scans the layers and not this root because instrumentation is not a pass, and
 * the line it rests on is enforced: `instrumentation-cannot-import-a-layer`
 * (`reachable: true`) stops this module reaching back into the thing it reports
 * on. Mutation-checked -- an import of a 1-Analyze module produces twelve
 * violations naming this file.
 *
 * The sibling arrives with the rest of #1452: the toolchain-requirement
 * accumulator, still inside `CodeGenState` today, is the same kind of fact and
 * belongs here too.
