# Symbol views and their scopes

How C-Next's symbol and type facts are stored today, which of those stores are views of one
fact set, whether they agree, and what to do about it.

This is the write-up of the [#1431](https://github.com/jlaustill/c-next/issues/1431) spike. The
probe that produced the numbers was throwaway and is not in the tree; it is recoverable from
that branch's history, and the method below is described in enough detail to rebuild it. Where
a figure came from a command rather than from the probe, the command is given.

## The question

[#1313](https://github.com/jlaustill/c-next/issues/1313) describes Cause 1 as four
representations of the same symbols that "agree only by coincidence". #1431 restated that as a
falsifiable claim: the stores are **denormalized materializations of one fact set with no
integrity constraint**, and the apparent "scopes" are one query with different predicates.

If that is right, a normalized schema reproduces every view as a query, and each place the
reproduction disagrees is a latent defect with an address. If it is wrong, the reproduction
fails and says where.

## The schema

Five tables were enough to express every view that could be expressed at all.

| table          | key                                        | source                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `symbol`       | `fullyQualifiedCName` (injective, ADR-063) | `SymbolTable`                          |
| `scope`        | path, `parentId` a self-referencing FK     | `SymbolRegistry`                       |
| `file`         | resolved path                              | discovery                              |
| `include_edge` | (`dependent`, `dependency`)                | `DependencyGraph`                      |
| `member`       | (`ownerCName`, `name`)                     | enum, bitmap, struct, register members |

Two shapes are load-bearing rather than stylistic.

**A scope is a row, not an object.** `parentId` is a foreign key.
[#1298](https://github.com/jlaustill/c-next/issues/1298) is a cycle guard that cannot fire,
because successive `.parent` reads can return non-identical objects for the same scope. Under a
key, a cycle is a constraint violation on insert and the guard has nothing left to guard. This
is what `docs/architecture/README.md` means by "an entry in a table that symbols point at, not
a live object graph they hang off".

**The include closure is a query, not a stored set.** It is the join
[#1398](https://github.com/jlaustill/c-next/issues/1398) says nobody wrote.

### The six scopes are one query with different predicates

| scope                    | predicate                         | verdict                                    |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| this file's parse tree   | `WHERE source_file = ?`           | real                                       |
| per-file include-visible | `WHERE source_file IN closure(?)` | real — this is the missing join            |
| run-wide                 | no predicate                      | real                                       |
| run-so-far               | `WHERE topological_index < ?`     | **not a scope** — a per-file-loop artifact |
| per-generate-call        | _not expressible_                 | **not a scope** — an orthogonal phase axis |
| cross-run persisted      | the warm cache                    | a materialized table, legitimately         |

`run-so-far` being an artifact is not an inference. `Transpiler.ts` says so at the site: under a
cyclic include graph `getSortedFiles()` returns insertion order with a warning, so "a file can
be declared before the file defining the scope types it uses… the pass this issue removed was
not only recomputing, it was **repairing**."

`per-generate-call` cannot be written as a predicate over these tables at all, because it is
"which pass has run", not "which symbols are in view".
[#1430](https://github.com/jlaustill/c-next/issues/1430) is what confusing the two produces.

## The partition

Every member of `ICodeGenSymbols`, `CodeGenState` and `SymbolTable` was classified, and **every
exclusion was then adversarially challenged** by an independent pass instructed to refute it.

| bucket          | count  |
| --------------- | ------ |
| symbol view     | **74** |
| codegen scratch | 24     |
| dead            | 4      |
| **audited**     | 102    |

**13 of 41 exclusions were overturned; none was overturned the other way.** That asymmetry is
the finding, not an accident of process: a name-grep classification is biased toward exclusion,
and exclusion is the direction that flatters the result. The three families it systematically
missed were indirect reads (`{ ...base }` spread, reads through a renamed interface field),
sink-versus-source tracing (the writer is a pure function several hops from the assignment), and
confusing a narrow _lifetime_ with a non-derivable _content_.

The practical consequence is that `CodeGenState` is smaller than it looks as a problem: 24 of
its 59 static data fields are emission bookkeeping, not views of the program.

## The measurement

Each hooked accessor records **three** answers for the same key at the same moment:

|                | meaning                                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `live`         | what the container returned                                 |
| `asSpecified`  | the same view re-expressed — same predicate, same key space |
| `asPrincipled` | the answer the normalized model says is correct             |

`asSpecified` is the **identity control**, and it is the reason the numbers below can be
believed. Two answers cannot distinguish a real divergence from a key-space mismatch, and
`ICodeGenSymbols` holds two key spaces at once: `knownScopes` and `scopeMembers` are keyed by
the bare leaf `scope.name`, `knownStructs` and `functionReturnTypes` by the transpiled C name.

**The identity control caught six defects in the measurement itself. Every one would have been
published as a finding.** Two examples: a kind filter of `{struct, typedef}` misses C++ `class`
(262 false divergences), and 530 more were header-declared types whose principled answer is
unanswerable for the reason in the next section. The tell for the second was distributional —
10 of 10 true cases "diverged", and a real divergence is a minority.

Observations are recorded in **files mode**, never source mode. Under source mode there is no
include graph, so `visibleFrom` collapses into `runWide` and every include-sensitive view agrees
trivially. `scripts/format-fidelity.ts` and the matrix tooling both drive the transpiler one
fixture at a time, which is why that trap is easy to fall into.

### Controls

Three layers, all firing, over 1143 fixtures and 7490 observations:

- **Per view** — corrupting each view's derivation reddens **exactly that view and no other**,
  6 of 6.
- **Global** — breaking the include closure moves identity mismatches 0 → 35 and divergence
  counts 0 → 44 and 0 → 78.
- **Directional** — `getStructFieldType`'s divergences run 32 → **0** when the closure is
  broken. That is the strongest attribution in the run: the divergence exists _because_ of
  cross-file visibility, so removing cross-file visibility removes it.

## Results

### There is one real divergence, and the reframe predicted it

`CodeGenState.getStructFieldType` answers **"no such field"** for a struct the file can see —
32 observations, all cross-file, all one direction.

`getStructFieldType` reads the per-file `structFields` and stops; it has no run-wide branch at
all. Its sibling `getStructFieldInfo` asks the run-wide table **first**. And `structFields` is
one of the collections that never crosses an include boundary, while `knownStructs` does — so an
included struct has a **known name and unknown fields**.

`TSymbolInfoAdapter`'s own comment, twenty lines above the merge list, records
[#1333](https://github.com/jlaustill/c-next/issues/1333) fixing this asymmetry for type _names_
and then says: _"A type's NAME is not enough; its detail travels with it."_ It merges enum
members and bitmap fields. It does not merge struct fields. The same bug, one kind over.

Whether each case is a live miscompile depends on whether callers reach for the sibling
accessor, which is run-wide-first. That is "agree only by coincidence" stated exactly: one
accessor is wrong, and the system works because callers of the other one happen to cover it.

### The bigger finding is that the question cannot be derived at all

**2626 of 7490 observations (35%) have no derivable include-visible answer at all**, for one
reason:

> A run builds **two** `DependencyGraph` instances. One holds `.cnx → .cnx` edges; the other,
> inside `IncludeResolver.resolveHeadersTransitively`, holds header → header edges. Both are
> locals, both are discarded, and **no edge anywhere connects a `.cnx` to a header it
> includes.**

The only surviving trace is `reachesForeignHeader` — one bit per file meaning "can this file see
_any_ foreign header". So "can this file see `CAN_message_t`?" is not an unwritten query; it is
unanswerable from what the transpiler keeps.

That sharpens #1398. It is not only that the edges exist and nobody joined them — for foreign
types **the edge does not exist in either graph**, so the join has nothing to join.

### The criteria

| #   | criterion                     | result                                                 |
| --- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | disagreements, control firing | one real divergence; the rest agree or are underivable |
| 2   | does the boundary typecheck   | typed **4/4**, as a string **0/4** [^ql]               |
| 3   | do the gates survive          | **engine rejected**                                    |
| 4   | cost                          | naive derive **+23.8%** against a 10% ceiling          |
| 5   | unreachable except by query   | a gate catches the realistic bypass                    |

**Criterion 3 is decisive — but the rule is not "no query strings".** That was this spike's
first phrasing and it is too narrow. Expressing the same coupling eight ways against the
project's own four layer rules gives the real boundary:

| how the coupling is written                            | depcruise                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| direct typed import                                    | **error**                          |
| free-function query imported from `output/`            | **error** (direct and transitive)  |
| provider table, layer-neutral result type              | silent                             |
| provider table, vocabulary laundered through `unknown` | silent — and `tsc --strict` exit 0 |
| SQL string                                             | silent                             |
| phase slice map naming the generate slice              | **error** (transitive)             |
| dynamic `import()` with a non-literal specifier        | silent — `tsc` exit 0              |

A provider table is fully typed, string-free and compiles clean, and the gate sees nothing. So
the rule is **the coupling must be a TypeScript import edge**. Phrased that way it rejects
provider tables, dynamic imports and query strings alike, and it accepts the free-function form
— which is why the recommendation below is queries as ordinary functions, never a registry.

Concretely, the same `logic/ → output/` coupling produces **130 errors** as a
typed import and **`✔ no dependency violations found`** as a SQL string, in a module that is
imported so `no-orphans` cannot account for it. #1297 fixed a gate that matched direct edges
only; under an engine, CI would print the same reassuring sentence for the same reason one layer
deeper — `logic/` reaching `output/` through a **string** — and no config flag fixes that,
because a dependency cruiser cannot follow a join inside a string literal.
`docs/architecture/README.md` states the principle it violates: **an invariant without a gate
does not count.**

**Criterion 4 fails for the naive derive**, exactly as pre-registered. The store is plain arrays
with no indices, because an index _is_ a materialized view and building one would reintroduce
the thing under measurement, and `visibleFrom` recomputes the closure on every call. Notably the
naive derive is slow for the _same reason the transpiler is_: it recomputes the include closure
instead of retaining it, and the transpiler does that three times per file per run, from disk.
One fix serves both.

### Bypass is already the majority, and that reframes criterion 5

The probe hooks accessors. Two of them — `isKnownBitmap` and `isKnownRegister` — were **never
asked** across 1143 fixtures. `isKnownBitmap` is dead. `isKnownRegister` is not: its concept is
used constantly, and the canonical accessor is simply bypassed.

Measured across the symbol surface:

| collection            | direct reads, bypassing any accessor | canonical accessor calls |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| `knownEnums`          | 23                                   | 14                       |
| `knownRegisters`      | 18                                   | **0**                    |
| `structFields`        | 16                                   | 4                        |
| `enumMembers`         | 15                                   | —                        |
| `knownScopes`         | 12                                   | 10                       |
| `knownBitmaps`        | 11                                   | **0**                    |
| `knownStructs`        | 9                                    | 9                        |
| `opaqueTypes`         | 8                                    | 3                        |
| `functionReturnTypes` | 6                                    | 5                        |
| **total**             | **118**                              | **45**                   |

Criterion 5 asked whether anything stops call site N+1 from bypassing a single store module.
Nothing does, and nothing has: **bypass is already 72% of the sites.** So routing through one
module is not the status quo being preserved, it is the change being proposed, and the gate is
what makes it hold rather than a nicety on top.

This also explains D1 without appealing to carelessness. "Five implementations of _is this a
struct?_" is what a codebase looks like when the canonical answer is one option among several
and no rule prefers it.

**It is also the main limitation of this measurement.** Hooking accessors observes roughly a
quarter of the sites where these questions are actually asked. Every divergence reported is
real — the identity control holds at 0 across 15852 observations — but the divergence count is
a floor, and a low one: `getStructFieldType`'s 32 cases come from 4 of the 20 `structFields`
question sites. Anyone continuing this should hook the **collections** behind a `Proxy` rather
than the accessors, so a read is observed regardless of who makes it.

## Defects found on the way

Ten, all reproduced and none fixed — a measurement that also changes behavior measures
nothing. Three were more serious than the reading that prompted them, which is the argument for
requiring a reproduction rather than a confident note.

[^ql]:
    The 0/4 is about **SQL specifically**, not query languages generally. CodeQL's QL, Glean's
    Angle and Soufflé all typecheck queries against a declared schema, and Glean additionally
    generates typed host bindings. They are rejected here on criterion 3, not criterion 2 — a
    query in a second language is not a TypeScript import edge, so enforcing the layer model
    under one of them means building and mutation-checking a second gate suite over a second
    toolchain.

## Recommendation

**Normalization as discipline, in plain TypeScript.** Specifically:

1. **Retain the include graph and memoize the closure.** It is currently built twice and thrown
   away twice, then rebuilt from disk twice more per file. This is the single change that
   brings the derive under the cost ceiling _and_ removes two redundant rebuilds, and it is a
   precondition for everything else.
2. **Give headers edges in that graph.** Until a `.cnx → header` edge exists, 35% of the
   questions asked of the symbol layer have no principled answer, and no schema can supply one.
3. **Make `structFields` cross the include boundary** on the same terms as `enumMembers` and
   `bitmapFields`, and give `getStructFieldType` and `getStructFieldInfo` one answer.
4. **Hide the raw collections from the exported type**, which is how TypeScript prevents the
   same bypass at zero runtime cost: `SourceFile.locals` exists at runtime and is simply not
   declared, and the public `Symbol` exposes seven of fourteen runtime slots. Four attempted
   bypasses fail under `--strict` with TS2339. This is cheaper and earlier than a gate, and it
   is the answer to 118 of 163 sites.
5. **Gate the store** as a backstop — mutation-check the gate in CI the way `layer-rules.test.ts` already
   checks that transitive rules carry `reachable: true`. An unchecked rule is how #1297
   happened.

**Do not adopt an in-memory SQL engine.** It is rejected on criterion 3 and independently
confirmed by criterion 2, before its dependency cost is even considered — and that cost is not
small: C-Next has eight runtime dependencies, all pure JavaScript, so `better-sqlite3` would be
the first native build in a toolchain that embedded developers install.

Because the engine is rejected, #1431's flag for #1313 resolves: an engine will not subsume
[#1323](https://github.com/jlaustill/c-next/issues/1323), and the Cause 1 taxonomy cards are not
blocked on that question.

#### Two techniques worth naming, and one card available today

**Derive lazily and memoize on the entity, not the pass.** TypeScript keeps derived facts in
`symbolLinks` / `nodeLinks` — arrays inside the checker closure, keyed by a lazily stamped id —
and measured on this repo's own 1107 files it produces 523,596 symbols but only **148,496
types**. About 72% of symbols never have the expensive fact derived at all. The +23.8% above is
a _pass_ cost because the probe derived everything; lazy per-question memoization converts it
into a per-question cost most questions never pay.

**Never memoize a value computed inside an unresolved cycle.** TypeScript threads an explicit
resolution stack and, on a real cycle, emits a circularity error rather than caching garbage.
That is exactly [#1433](https://github.com/jlaustill/c-next/issues/1433), where
`collectDependentsOf` memoizes a cycle-cut `false` and E0427 then falsely rejects. The fix is
the general property, not a patch to one walk.

**And one gate is shippable now, independent of any of this.** A rule forbidding
`logic/analysis/` from reaching `state/CodeGenState.ts`, with `reachable: true`, reports **26
violations across 15 non-test source modules** on the current tree — several only transitively,
so the reachability flag is doing real work. It fails on exactly the #1430 / #1432 case, needs
no dependency and no type work, and is the precondition for phase-typing that boundary later:
phase types over a codebase that still reaches a module-global are decorative, because the
analyzer never held the value the type describes.

## What this does not say

The probe covers the views it hooked, not all 74. The divergence count is a floor. The
recommendation rests on criteria 2 through 5, which are properties of the _options_ and do not
depend on how many views were probed; criterion 1's verdict is the one that would move with
more coverage, and it can only move toward more divergence, which strengthens the same
recommendation rather than changing it.
