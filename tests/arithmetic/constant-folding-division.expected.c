// Issue #235: Constant folding for division expressions
// Tests that compile-time constant expressions are evaluated during transpilation
// Test 1: Pure literal division - should fold to constants

// Should fold to: 4

// Should fold to: 16
// Test 2: .length property division (the original bug report)
// .length returns compile-time constants (bit-width), so these should fold
