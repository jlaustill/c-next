/**
 * #1322. ADR-010's include rules -- E0503 (an implementation file), E0504 (a
 * `.cnx` sits where the header does), E0506 (an included `.cnx` is not there)
 * -- replacing three codegen throws that all reported `1:0`, two of them with
 * the real line appended to the message as `Line N` and the third with no code
 * at all.
 *
 * The 23 cases these replace were handed a directive's TEXT and a line NUMBER,
 * which is precisely why the position defect was invisible to them: there was
 * no position to get wrong. These parse a directive and assert where it is.
 *
 * #1672: the analyzer reports 1.1 Discover's answer, so a test builds that
 * answer the way the run does -- with the real `IncludeResolver`, over an
 * in-memory file system holding the files the test says exist. Each case
 * asserts 1.1's decision and 2.1's report of it together.
