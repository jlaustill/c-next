This tests the interaction between two concurrency mechanisms.\n\n## Priority\nMedium\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Test file created in `tests/atomic/atomic-in-critical.cnx`\n- [ ] Test passes (or fails if it reveals a bug - see workflow)\n- [ ] `coverage.md` updated: `[ ]` changed to `[x]` with test file reference for atomic In critical section\n- [ ] Jest test runner passes\n\n## Test Implementation Notes\n- Declare an atomic variable\n- Access and modify it inside a critical block\n- Test both read and compound assignment operations within critical\n- Verify the transpiled C code handles both atomic operations and interrupt disabling correctly\n- Consider whether atomic operations inside critical are redundant (should still compile)\n- Example:\n  ```\n  atomic u32 sharedCounter <- 0;\n\n  fn updateCounter() -> void {\n      critical (sharedCounter) {\n          sharedCounter +<- 1;\n          // More complex logic that requires atomicity\n      }\n  }\n  ```\n\n## Bug Handling\nIf this test reveals a bug:\n1. Merge the failing test first\n2. Create a separate ticket to fix the bug\n3. The bug fix ticket should reference this test\n",
