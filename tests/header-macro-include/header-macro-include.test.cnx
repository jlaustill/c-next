// Tests: Issue #424 - Generated header includes macro-defining headers
// When a macro from an included header is used in an array size,
// the generated .h file must include that header for the extern declaration.
//
// Note: We avoid accessing the array here because macro-defined array
// sizes have a known limitation with bit-indexing detection.
