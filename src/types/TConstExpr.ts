/**
 * An integer expression whose value may be needed while the program compiles
 * -- an array dimension, an enum member's value, a const's initializer -- as
 * plain data (#1175, #1669).
 *
 * ## Why not the parse tree, and why not its text
 *
 * The tree is Tier 1 with a short lifetime: 1.3 Declare consumes it and does
 * not re-export it (#1317, docs/architecture/README.md), so a pass after 1.3
 * cannot hold one. Its `getText()` is not a substitute. ANTLR joins the tokens
 * with no separator, so the text re-lexes as different tokens: `(LIM < -1)`
 * reads back as `(LIM<-1)`, where `<-` is assignment, and `1 - -1` reaches C as
 * `1--1`, which C reads as a decrement. This form is lowered from the tree once,
 * where the tree is in hand, and every pass evaluates it by the one rule in
 * `ConstantEvaluator`.
 *
 * Plain data, so a symbol carrying it stays JSON-encodable (#1298): a literal
 * holds its value as decimal digits, because a u64 is past what a `number`
 * holds exactly and a `bigint` is not JSON.
