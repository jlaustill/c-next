 * The one bit write: the target without its final subscript, rendered by

 *
 * Five handlers and the member-chain one each rebuilt the base from the
 * source spelling, so a local renamed `f__gs` was written as the global
 * `gs`, and each picked the mask's width from a type NAME only `u64`/`i64`
 * matched: a header's `uint64_t` or a `u64` struct field got `1U << 40`,
 * undefined behavior. The width is the typer's now, for the value the
 * subscript indexes, whatever its spelling -- and the MISRA C:2012 Rule
 * 10.3 narrowing cast comes with it for every form, not only two.
 * `BitUtils` takes it as the C type the value is stored in, which is what a
 * bitmap, a register member and a float's bits give it too.
 *
 * #1760 review: the value's category decides the write, once, for every
 * target. A float's bits go through a union, an element's and a field's too
 * (they fell through to a plain subscript store, and a variable was the only
 * float this reached). An integer the target gives no width, such as a
 * header's `int_fast16_t`, is written in `uintmax_t` by its own type name
 * (owner ruling), where a 32-bit mask cleared the upper half of a `long`.
