/**
 * TypeNameLadder -- the one ladder from a written type's plain data to its
 * resolved C-Next name (#1285, #1932).
 *
 * Seven independent `scopedType()/globalType()/qualifiedType()/userType()`
 * ladders existed: two in TypeRegistrationEngine, one each in TypeUtils,
 * CodeGenerator.getTypeName, FunctionContextManager, TypeGenerationHelper, and
 * CodeGenerator's parameter path. Each decided ADR-057 qualification for itself,
 * so unifying the encoder (#1285 PR3) left seven places that still had to agree
 * about WHICH branch to apply it in.
 *
 * They already disagreed about coverage: each handled a different subset of the
 * six `arrayType` element alternatives, and their fallbacks differed (null vs
 * the raw parse text). Those subsets ARE reachable, and collapsing the ladders
 * closed two of them:
 *
 *   - `CodeGenerator.getTypeName` handled only `primitiveType` and `userType`
 *     inside `arrayType`, so `const Scope.TItem[] items <- ...` fell through to
 *     `ctx.getText()` and yielded the raw parse text `Scope.TItem[]`. The field
 *     types were then unknown and the initializer literals lost their integer
 *     suffixes (tests/header-generation/const-struct-array-inferred).
 *   - `getZeroInitializer` resolved a bare `userType()` unqualified, so a
 *     scope-local enum missed `knownEnums` and got the aggregate zero brace
 *     instead of ADR-017's zero member
 *     (tests/bugs/issue-1285-scope-enum-zero-init).
 *
 * So this is a bug fix as well as a unification, and the corpus does move --
 * in exactly those two places, both verified as corrections rather than
 * regressions before their snapshots were regenerated.
 *
 * Split out of 1.3's `TypeBinding` (#1932, owner decision on #1952), which
 * read parse contexts through `ITypeAccessors`. Its last caller lowers the type
 * with `SyntaxLowering` and asks here instead (#1960 review), so `TypeBinding`
 * is gone: 1.3, 2.1, the walker and Render all ask this one ladder, over plain
 * data. The predicates are injected rather than read from codegen state.
