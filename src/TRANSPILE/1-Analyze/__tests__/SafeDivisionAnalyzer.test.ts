 * #1322. ADR-051's call shape: E0884 (four arguments) and E0885 (the first is
 * a variable that can receive the result).
 *
 * The arity rule and the "not a variable at all" arm are pure parse-tree work
 * and are asserted here. The arm that separates a declared FUNCTION from a
 * declared VARIABLE reads the program's symbols; `tests/adr-051/` asserts it
 * end to end.
