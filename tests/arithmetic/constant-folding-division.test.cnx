// Issue #235: Constant folding for division expressions
// Tests that compile-time constant expressions are evaluated during transpilation

// Test 1: Pure literal division - should fold to constants
u32 literal_result1 <- 32 / 8;      // Should fold to: 4
u32 literal_result2 <- 100 / 10;    // Should fold to: 10
u32 literal_result3 <- 64 / 4;      // Should fold to: 16

// Test 2: .length property division (the original bug report)
// .length returns compile-time constants (bit-width), so these should fold
u32 x;
u8 bytes_for_u32 <- x.length / 8;   // 32 / 8 should fold to: 4

u64 y;
u8 bytes_for_u64 <- y.length / 8;   // 64 / 8 should fold to: 8

u16 z;
u8 bytes_for_u16 <- z.length / 8;   // 16 / 8 should fold to: 2

// Test 3: Other arithmetic operations on constants
u32 mult_result <- 4 * 8;           // Should fold to: 32
u32 add_result <- 10 + 20;          // Should fold to: 30
u32 sub_result <- 100 - 40;         // Should fold to: 60

void main() {
    // Empty - this test validates generated code, not runtime behavior
}
