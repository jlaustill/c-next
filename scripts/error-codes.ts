/**
 * Issue #1322: gate `docs/error-codes.md`, which says of itself that it has none.
 *
 * The registry is where "next available" is read from, so a code reserved in
 * one place and recorded nowhere is assigned twice and the collision is silent.
 * This card allocates roughly 45-60 codes into a file holding 55.
 *
 * Test code (`SourceModule.isModule`: `__tests__/`, `__testUtils__/`) is
 * excluded from the emitted set (`EmittedCodes`) with one exception that is not
 * an exception at all: E0000 is the reserved generic test code, and its only
 * emitter is the unit test that asserts the shape of `IBaseAnalysisError`. Its
 * row names that test file as its source, so the registry already documents
 * where it lives -- scanning tests wholesale instead would let a code invented
 * in a mock register itself as real.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does not catch
 *
 * "Emitted" means the token `E####` appears anywhere in a non-test `.ts` file,
 * comments included. So a code deleted from its throw but still named in a
 * docstring reads as emitted, and the "no source emits it" arm will not fire.
 *
 * That is the right trade rather than an oversight. Codes are raised in several
 * shapes -- a `code:` field, a `E0856:` prefix inside a template literal, an
 * `error[E0503]:` tag -- which is why `DiagnosticManifest` matches text too,
 * and matching only the `code:` field form would miss most of `output/`. The
 * arm that actually guards against silent double-assignment is the other one:
 * a code emitted with no row. That one is exact, because a code cannot be
 * raised without its digits appearing somewhere.
